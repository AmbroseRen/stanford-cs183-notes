# Ooshma Garg at Startup School SV 2016

> `[00:00:02]` Good morning everybody. And.

`[00:00:02]` 大家早上好。和

> `[00:00:10]` Thank you all for coming and spending your Saturday with us. This is always one of our favorite days of the year. We get to meet many new founders. There\'s a long tradition of people in the audience leader coming to speak at Startup School after they start a company and become really successful. So I hope you enjoy the talks we have today. I especially hope you get to know each other. I think a lot of the value comes from the casual conversations that breaks at lunch and after the event we have an incredible set of speakers today also I\'m going teach a class in the first half of 2017 and it is a successor to the class that I taught last two years ago called How to start a startup and hopefully we\'ll be a lot better. So if you\'re interested in more content after today please check it out. If you go to Startup School dot org today you can put your e-mail address and then we\'ll let you know when we\'re ready to go.

`[00:00:10]` 谢谢大家来和我们一起度过你们的星期六。这是我们一年中最喜欢的日子之一。我们有机会认识许多新的创始人。观众领袖有一个悠久的传统，他们在创办一家公司后来到创业学校演讲，并取得了真正的成功。所以我希望你们喜欢我们今天的会谈。我特别希望你们能互相了解。我认为很大一部分价值来自于午餐休息时的随意对话。活动结束后，我们今天有了一群令人难以置信的演讲者，我还打算在 2017 年上半年教授一堂课，这是我两年前教授的“如何创业”课程的接班人，希望我们能做得更好。所以如果你今天以后对更多的内容感兴趣，请查收。如果你今天去 StartupSchooldoorg，你可以把你的电子邮件地址，然后我们会告诉你，当我们准备去。

> `[00:01:00]` Our first speaker today is Mogahed Bushmen\'s the founder of gobble gobble is a C Company Bhishma is one of the many speakers today that has been in the audience many times before and today she runs a company that not only am I a happy user of my mom sends me gobble boxes because she thinks anymore but the company next year will do more than 100 million dollars in sales.

`[00:01:00]` 我们今天的第一位演讲者是莫哈德·布什曼，“戈布”的创始人是一家 C 公司，比什马是今天许多演讲者中的一员，他以前多次出现在听众中，今天她经营着一家公司，她不仅是我妈妈的一个快乐用户，因为她认为，公司明年的销售额将超过 1 亿美元。

> `[00:01:24]` Yeah.

`[00:01:24]` 是的。

> `[00:01:27]` FISHER So Schmidt thank you very much for coming and speaking with us. And here she is.

`[00:01:27]` 费舍尔，施密特非常感谢你来和我们交谈。她来了。

> `[00:01:43]` Thank you so much Sam how are you guys doing today. Wow what an audience. SAMBAS SO nice to call me a speaker with a lineup that you have today. I consider myself an opener.

`[00:01:43]` 非常感谢萨姆，你们今天过得好吗？哇多好的观众啊。桑巴斯真是太好了，我是一个有着今天阵容的演讲者。我认为自己是开场白。

> `[00:01:56]` You have such an amazing set of speakers today. I\'m just very grateful to be here and share this moment with you. My name is Schmied and I\'m the CEO and founder of gobble. We help anyone cook dinner in just ten minutes.

`[00:01:56]` 你今天的演说家真是太棒了。我非常感激能在这里和你分享这一刻。我叫施密德，我是戈布尔公司的首席执行官和创始人。我们只需十分钟就能帮任何人做饭。

> `[00:02:12]` We\'re the inventors of the ten minute one pan dinner kit today. I\'m gonna tell you my story and also the power of a mission I could tell you the whole story with our graph.

`[00:02:12]` 我们是今天十分钟一盘晚餐的发明者。我要告诉你们我的故事，还有任务的力量，我可以用我们的图表告诉你们整个故事。

> `[00:02:30]` This is a stripe revenue data dump of our revenue over the last five years.

`[00:02:30]` 这是过去五年我们收入的条状数据转储。

> `[00:02:37]` If I were you I would be wondering what happens right here.

`[00:02:37]` 如果我是你，我会想知道这里发生了什么。

> `[00:02:41]` Laughter doesn\'t it look like I had no idea what I was doing. And then we just figured everything out.

`[00:02:41]` 笑声看起来好像我不知道自己在做什么，然后我们就把一切都搞清楚了。

> `[00:02:51]` And fortunately that\'s not the case. In order to understand what happens at the promised land you have to know what happens at the beginning the middle and all along the way the words that you see up there are actually the words of the startup curve.

`[00:02:51]` 幸运的是，事实并非如此。为了了解在应许之地发生的事情，你必须知道最初发生了什么，中间发生了什么，一直以来，你看到的单词实际上都是创业曲线上的单词。

> `[00:03:11]` Paul Graham to coin this and said that most great startups follow this curve. You start with this really exciting launch. Little do you know that you\'re falling into a multi-year slog and Trough of Sorrow. Then you get Wiggles of hope. I call them hope because any sign at that point is good. But he calls them Wiggles of false hope. And if you have the stamina and the grit maybe you\'ll reach the promised land. I started golfball when I had another company. I was helping students get jobs at law firms banks and consulting firms and I was a student myself at Stanford as you know. Startups are a 24/7 job.

`[00:03:11]` 保罗·格雷厄姆说，大多数伟大的创业公司都遵循这条曲线。你从这个非常令人兴奋的发射开始。你几乎不知道你陷入了多年的苦痛和悲伤的低谷。那你就得到了希望之威。我称他们为希望，因为那时的任何迹象都是好的。但他称他们为虚假希望的 Wiggles。如果你有毅力和勇气，也许你就会到达应许之地。当我有另一家公司的时候我就开始打高尔夫球了。我帮助学生在律师事务所、银行和咨询公司找到工作，你知道，我也是斯坦福大学的学生。初创公司是一份 24/7 的工作。

> `[00:03:58]` I started treating myself like crap.

`[00:03:58]` 我开始把自己当废物对待。

> `[00:04:01]` I would survive off of Starbucks and take out I would eat alone at my desk and alone in my car and I would eat in my car more times than I would eat at my apartment eating takeout was very unhealthy and very lonely. This is even more personal for me because I grew up with a very colorful upbringing of nutritious home cooked Indian food.

`[00:04:01]` 我会从星巴克中幸存下来，我会一个人在办公桌上吃东西，一个人在车里吃，在车里吃的次数比在公寓里吃的次数还要多，外卖是非常不健康的，也是非常孤独的。这对我来说更加私人化了，因为我成长的时候有着丰富多彩的营养丰富的家常菜。

> `[00:04:33]` It is delicious. I would come home after track practice to my dad who would be singing and cooking in the kitchen and starting this ritual that was near and dear to our family.

`[00:04:33]` 它很好吃。我回家后，跟踪练习，我的父亲，他将唱歌和烹饪在厨房，并开始这一仪式，这是我们家人的亲切感。

> `[00:04:45]` Every night of enjoying dinner as a family connected together when I went to school and started companies this tradition went down the drain.

`[00:04:45]` 每天晚上，当我去学校开公司的时候，作为一家人在一起享受晚餐，这一传统就付诸东流了。

> `[00:04:58]` My dad actually flew here to California and he packed to India size suitcases full of his food and filled my fridge. It was at that point that I thought there had to be another way.

`[00:04:58]` 我爸爸实际上飞到了加利福尼亚，他把装满食物的手提箱和冰箱装到了印度。就在这一点上，我认为必须有另一种方式。

> `[00:05:14]` I posted an ad on Craigslist and asked who will make me dinner for 8 dollars a plate. In 24 hours we had 70 responses. There were people all over the Bay Area that wanted to bring me food and we\'re so proud of their cooking and wanted to earn a living with it.

`[00:05:14]` 我在 Craigslist 上贴了一则广告，问谁给我做一盘 8 美元的晚餐。在 24 小时内，我们得到了 70 个反应。整个海湾地区都有人想给我带来食物，我们对他们的烹饪感到非常自豪，并想以此为生。

> `[00:05:35]` At first I thought oh my gosh this is a great dinner HACC.

`[00:05:35]` 起初我想，天哪，这是一顿很棒的晚餐。

> `[00:05:42]` I called all my friends and I said Hey I have all these chefs and their interview is to cook us dinner. Do you want some free food.

`[00:05:42]` 我给我所有的朋友打了电话，我说嘿，我有这么多厨师，他们的采访是给我们做晚餐。你想要些免费的食物吗。

> `[00:05:52]` You can guess the response. I was the most popular friend for a good three months there.

`[00:05:52]` 你可以猜到答案。我是那里三个月来最受欢迎的朋友。

> `[00:05:58]` I emailed the chefs they would come and make food for us. And what started as fun and games and just feeding myself very quickly became a serious opportunity I made a calendar of chefs that we liked and the meals that they would cook each day. And then I emailed my friends to ask who won a dinner that day. It was that simple.

`[00:05:58]` 我给厨师发了电子邮件，他们会来为我们做食物。从乐趣和游戏开始，很快就给自己提供了一个很好的机会，我制作了一份我们喜欢的厨师日历，以及他们每天要做的饭菜。然后我给朋友发电子邮件询问那天谁赢了一顿晚餐。就这么简单。

> `[00:06:20]` I was just organically feeding myself and my friends what started on paper and to pay pal and me driving my car was actually the foundation of what would become a business. The supply and demand was building and I was getting really happy. I was getting happy again and I saw that a mission was forming. I tried to figure out what was energizing me and I was getting my home back and my my tradition back and I was I was feeling love again. And I was giving my friends healthy home cooked food and nourishing my soul. People were starting to order dinner for me everyday. I wanted to take this further some of my friends told me Well if you want to make this a business you\'ll need to get a technical co-founder. So I started shopping for cofounders. I did founder dating we went to coffee we went to drinks and ultimately I couldn\'t find anyone that was willing to quit their job that cared about this idea as much as I did. And that really wanted to play the long game with me.

`[00:06:20]` 我只是在有机地养活自己和我的朋友们-从纸上开始，付钱给朋友和我，开着我的车，这实际上是一项业务的基础。供应和需求都在增加，我真的很高兴。我又高兴起来了，我看到一个任务正在形成。我试图弄清楚是什么让我精力充沛，我找回了我的家，找回了我的传统，我再次感受到了爱。我给我的朋友们吃健康的家常菜和滋养我的灵魂。人们开始每天为我点晚餐。我想更进一步，我的一些朋友告诉我，好吧，如果你想把这做生意，你需要找一个技术上的联合创始人。所以我开始为联合创始人买东西。我做了创办人约会，我们去喝咖啡，喝了一杯，最后我找不到愿意辞职的人，他们像我一样关心这个想法。那真的很想和我玩长时间游戏。

> `[00:07:34]` So then I said I feel so strongly about this. Screw it I\'m gonna do it anyway. I started talking to my friends about who I could reach out to that might want to invest in me. I made a list of investors. One of them at the top of that list was Keith boy. He was an early investor in Araby in B and Yelp and at the time he had just invested in Araby in B and now he\'s a partner at Khosla Ventures some of my friends and knew him and I knew he would love what we were doing.

`[00:07:34]` 然后我说我对这件事有强烈的感觉。去他的我还是要去做。我开始和我的朋友们谈论我能接触到的人，他们可能会对我进行投资。我列了一份投资者名单。他们中最重要的一个是基思男孩。他是在 B 和 Yelp 的 Araby 的早期投资者，当时他刚刚在 B 投资 Araby，现在他是 Khosla Ventures 的合伙人，我的一些朋友认识他，我知道他会喜欢我们正在做的事情。

> `[00:08:07]` From the consumer side and just from the essence of the business. So I asked for some introductions. One friend introduced me to Keith who is now a multi billion dollar public company CEO.

`[00:08:07]` 从消费者的角度出发，从企业的本质出发。所以我要了些介绍。一位朋友把我介绍给基思，他现在是一家价值数十亿美元的上市公司首席执行官。

> `[00:08:20]` And Keith said Sorry I just started a new job at Square. I\'m not investing in any more companies so then I asked another friend. I said No no no. He doesn\'t know what what he really wants.

`[00:08:20]` 基思说，对不起，我刚在广场开始了一份新工作。我不再投资其他公司了，于是我又问了另一个朋友。我说了不。他不知道他到底想要什么。

> `[00:08:33]` So I asked another friend and that friend is another NYSE founder Bill clerical if we pay.

`[00:08:33]` 所以我问了另一个朋友，那个朋友是纽约证券交易所的另一位创办人比尔，如果我们付钱的话。

> `[00:08:42]` He asked Keith if Keith would be willing to meet with me and Keith said the same thing. No no I\'m starting a new job. No new investments. Finally I asked my friend Jason photography who was one of the biggest founding designers atMint.com and also a serial entrepreneur who actually connected me on e-mail with Keith so that gave me an opportunity to follow up. You can see here that every few days for almost six weeks I was just emailing him little pings with no response. So I meet up with Jason at Red Rock Cafe right here in Mountain View and he says Schmuhl what\'s going on. Keith met you yet.

`[00:08:42]` 他问基思是否愿意见我，基思也说了同样的话。不，我要开始一份新工作。没有新的投资。最后，我问了我的朋友杰森摄影，他是 Mint.com 最大的创始设计师之一，也是一位系列企业家，他通过电子邮件将我与基思联系在一起，这给了我一个跟进的机会。你可以在这里看到，近六周来，每隔几天我都会给他发电子邮件，但没有回复。所以我在山景城的红岩咖啡厅见过杰森，他说施穆尔这是怎么回事。基思见过你了。

> `[00:09:24]` And I said no and I feel so strongly that he would love what I\'m doing. And he goes do you want me to text him.

`[00:09:24]` 我拒绝了，我强烈地感觉他会喜欢我正在做的事情。他说：“你想让我给他发短信吗？”

> `[00:09:33]` And I said yes. Do it. And if we could have sent him emerges Snapp\'s Goofy\'s.

`[00:09:33]` 我答应了。去做吧。如果我们能让他出现斯纳普的高飞。

> `[00:09:41]` At the time I would have added those on to the good news is that it worked. Jason texted Keith and he said Oh my God I\'ll give her twenty minutes. Can she be here in an hour.

`[00:09:41]` 当时我会把这些加在好消息上，那就是它起作用了。杰森发短信给基思，他说，天哪，我给她 20 分钟。她一小时后能到吗？

> `[00:09:54]` Pro tip If you ever want to meet someone that\'s really hard to reach and you really want to meet them. Always tell them you\'re nearby or next door.

`[00:09:54]` 如果你想遇到一个你很难接触到的人，而且你真的很想见到他，请告诉他你在附近或隔壁。

> `[00:10:05]` Laughter I got in my car and I sped so fast down the 1 0 1 to squares offices in San Francisco panting as I got into his office but really trying to act like I was just around the corner.

`[00:10:05]` 当我走进他的办公室时，我在我的车里得到了笑声，我飞快地跑下 10 0 1 到旧金山的广场办公室，但我真的试图表现得好像我就在拐角处。

> `[00:10:23]` Within five minutes Keith came up and met me and he said Who are you. I got into my pitch. Another five minutes later he was writing our first check. That\'s how I got our first seed investor which led to many more.

`[00:10:23]` 不到五分钟，基思走过来见了我，他说你是谁。我进入了我的球场。五分钟后，他给我们写了第一张支票。这就是我第一次获得种子投资者的原因，这导致了更多的种子投资者。

> `[00:10:43]` And we raised our seed round that stunned me for a moment.

`[00:10:43]` 我们扬起种子，吓了我一跳。

> `[00:10:59]` Everything was going so great. I remember the feeling we got in the office. I started hiring people. We launched our first product. I sent out a company update.

`[00:10:59]` 一切都很顺利。我记得我们在办公室的感觉。我开始雇人。我们推出了我们的第一款产品。我发了一份公司的最新消息。

> `[00:11:11]` All of our investors were so happy. Little did I know.

`[00:11:11]` 我们所有的投资者都很高兴。我几乎不知道。

> `[00:11:18]` Laughter.

`[00:11:18]` 笑声。

> `[00:11:20]` We stood on a cliff overlooking this vast Trough of Sorrow in the first few months I fought tooth and nail for every user.

`[00:11:20]` 在头几个月里，我们站在悬崖上，俯瞰着这一巨大的悲伤槽，我为每一个使用者拼命奋斗。

> `[00:11:34]` I would go to coffee shops and convince them to put my little gobble card on the counter. I would go to mom\'s groups and pitch gobble myself in front of groups of 20 than 50 moms that are local in the area. These are photos of personal letters that are Tume and I wrote that I actually stuck my favorite flower on which is also from area. This Peruvian Lily. I stuck it on every envelope and then we put our running shoes on and our headphones and we ran up and down the streets of Palo Alto putting these envelopes at every door.

`[00:11:34]` 我会去咖啡店，说服他们把我的小卡片放在柜台上。我会去参加妈妈的小组，在当地 20 多个妈妈的面前狼吞虎咽地吃。这些是我和 Tume 的私人信件的照片，我写到我实际上把我最喜欢的花贴在上面，这也是来自地区的花。这个秘鲁莉莉。我把它贴在每个信封上，然后我们穿上跑鞋，戴上耳机，在帕洛阿尔托的街道上跑来跑去，把这些信封贴在每扇门上。

> `[00:12:08]` Why he tells you to do things that don\'t scale. This is the thing that doesn\'t scale. First you figure out your distribution innovation and then you\'ll figure out how to scale it. Things weren\'t working so well for us. We weren\'t taking off and we were in that trough of sorrow. A lot of people told me to consider enterprise catering. They said that I would make a lot of money and they had dollar signs in their eyes. In the interest to have an up them to the right graph I went about enterprise catering. I started emailing different portfolio lisps and we started feeding lots of companies. We were making lots and lots of money this is a slide from my first series a fundraising deck it\'s up and to the right. We\'re making more money. It was everything that I thought we needed and went out to raise Series A pretty quickly. Investors saw that 80 percent of my revenue was from Enterprise catering. But 100 percent of my vision was for consumer and for families I fell flat on my face. And after 40 meetings and six months of sales and fundraising I had no salary is a and I had no progress on my mission. The feeling is best explained by a quote from one of my favorite plays. McBeath he says I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent. But only vaulting ambition which oversleeps itself and falls on the other side. This is exactly what happened to me I had all ambition but I had lost my mission. My North Star was revenue we remained in the trough of sorrow investors were losing faith in us at this point. I had tried two different full models for gobble. I had tried to raise Series A and failed one of our angel investors even asked me to get acquired by a clothing startup. It was then that I started listening to my instincts and my insights. I had been working on gobble for a bit over two years and I knew that I was the only person who had who had been thinking about this 24/7 and who had all the learnings to come up with something brand new that align with my true mission. This was our first real step forward I thought to myself dinner is something we eat every single day. Technology is at the point where it should be able to guess exactly what you want at any given time for any different industry. Especially with food I was in admiration of companies like Netflix and Pandora and their personalization technology and I thought to myself its crazy that no one has applied this to the food industry. It was my vision van that what the future would look like is a software that had a Pandora like personalization algorithm that took all of my tastes my past orders what people like similar to me and would be able to guess and suggest what I should eat for dinner every single day. Thats what we built.

`[00:12:08]` 为什么他叫你去做不刻度的事。这就是不缩放的东西。首先，你要搞清楚你的分销创新，然后你就会想出如何扩大它的规模。事情对我们不太好。我们没有起飞，我们在悲伤的槽里。很多人告诉我要考虑企业餐饮。他们说我会赚很多钱，他们的眼睛里有美元符号。为了让他们达到正确的图形，我开始了企业餐饮。我开始用电子邮件发送不同的投资组合，我们开始为很多公司提供服务。我们赚了很多钱，这是我第一季的一张幻灯片，一张募捐牌，它在右边。我们正在赚更多的钱。这是我认为我们需要的一切，所以我们很快就出发了。投资者看到，我 80%的收入来自企业餐饮。但是，我 100%的视力是为消费者和家庭，我跌倒在我的脸。经过 40 次会议，6 个月的销售和筹款，我没有薪水，我的任务也没有进展。这种感觉最好通过引用我最喜欢的戏剧之一来解释。麦克比，他说我没有动力去戳我的意图。但只有跳伞的野心才会使自己睡得昏昏欲睡，倒在另一边。这正是发生在我身上的事情，我有野心，但我失去了我的使命。我的北极星是收入，我们仍然处于低谷，此时投资者对我们失去了信心。我试过两种完全不同的狼吞虎咽的模式。我曾试图提高 A 系列，但失败了，我们的天使投资者甚至要求我被一家服装初创公司收购。就在那时，我开始倾听自己的直觉和洞察力。我已经工作了两年多了，我知道我是唯一一个每天 24 小时都在思考这件事的人，我学会了想出一个与我真正的使命相一致的全新的东西。这是我们前进的第一步，我想晚餐是我们每天都要吃的东西。技术正处于这样的时刻，它应该能够准确地猜出你在任何不同行业的任何特定时刻想要什么。尤其是在食品方面，我非常钦佩 Netflix 和 Pandora 这样的公司，以及他们的个性化技术。我认为，没有人将这一点应用于食品行业，这真是太疯狂了。是我的视觉车，未来的样子是一个软件，它有一个像潘多拉一样的个性化算法，它吸收了我所有的口味-我以前的命令-人们喜欢我喜欢的东西，并且能够猜测和建议我每天晚餐应该吃什么。这就是我们建造的。

> `[00:16:10]` It started taking off and it was showing in the numbers we were making five times the revenue of any previous global model and over 35 percent of people were eating gobble on autopilot. That meant that I understood their tastes and I could send them a menu and that they wouldn\'t change it at all. Some people would add sides or change their meals. But this was really exciting to me.

`[00:16:10]` 它开始起飞，从数字中可以看出，我们的收入是以往任何一种全球模式的五倍，超过 35%的人在自动驾驶仪上吃着口水。这意味着我理解他们的口味，我可以给他们送一份菜单，他们根本不会改变它。有些人会加边或改变他们的膳食。但这对我来说真的很令人兴奋。

> `[00:16:39]` I went out to race series A again. We had an awesome software product it was showing much more success. It would definitely be our moment. Unfortunately many other food startups had started during this time and now they had gotten their investment before. I was looking for a mine so venture capital firms had already made their bet or they thought that the space was too crowded and they wanted to see how everything would play out. I failed at raising series A again and this time the fall was much harder because I was running out of money. One of my friends suggested why don\'t you think about and try Y Combinator.

`[00:16:39]` 我又去参加了 A 系列比赛。我们有一个很棒的软件产品，它显示出更多的成功。这绝对是我们的时刻。不幸的是，许多其他食品初创企业都是在这段时间内起步的，现在他们已经获得了投资。我在找一个矿山，所以风险投资公司已经下注了，或者他们认为这个地方太拥挤了，他们想看看一切会如何发展。我又一次没能提高 A 季的成绩，这一次下降得更困难了，因为我的钱快用完了。我的一个朋友建议你为什么不考虑试试 Y 组合器呢？

> `[00:17:31]` My first reaction was that this is a huge blow to my pride. I\'ve worked so hard and we\'ve already raised a seed round.

`[00:17:31]` 我的第一反应是，这是对我的骄傲的巨大打击。我工作得很努力，我们已经结出了一颗种子。

> `[00:17:39]` How could I go to a startup accelerator when your choices. Are to join Y Combinator or die.

`[00:17:39]` 当你选择的时候，我怎么能去创业加速器呢？是加入 Y 组合器还是死掉。

> `[00:17:50]` Laughter You put your ego aside and you choose Y Combinator.

`[00:17:50]` 笑声你抛开你的自我，选择 Y 组合器。

> `[00:18:00]` I am so glad I did Y Combinator was the lifeline that we needed and we wouldn\'t be here today without them. Just so you know how bad it was. I had made my last full payroll before getting the wife\'s money. We had employees we had drivers we had customers ordering and I was so close to losing everything. That I was staring into death and Y Combinator saved us. We still had to be scrappy. You have to remember that that whole time in the trough of sorrow you have to make every penny count and even afterwards this is a photo of our head of engineering Chris Woodforde and I.

`[00:18:00]` 我很高兴我做到了，Y 组合器是我们需要的生命线，没有它们我们今天就不会在这里。让你知道事情有多糟。在拿到妻子的钱之前，我已经发了最后一份全额工资。我们有员工，有司机，有客户定购，我几乎要失去一切了。我正盯着死亡而 Y 组合器救了我们。我们还是要斗志昂扬。你必须记住，在悲伤的槽里，你必须把每一分钱都计算在内，甚至在那之后，这是我们的工程师克里斯·伍德福德和我的一张照片。

> `[00:18:55]` We\'re putting all putting on all of our rain gear because our office was this rickety warehouse in East Palo Alto that would leak from the roof when it rained so we would have buckets next to our IMAX cinema displays during the spring because the roof was leaky. One day it was so bad that it started flooding under the building and getting into our floor. So this is us getting in gear to put sandbags all around our warehouse and try to stop the flooding.

`[00:18:55]` 我们把所有的雨具都穿上，因为我们的办公室是东帕洛阿尔托的一个摇摇欲坠的仓库，下雨时会从屋顶漏出来，所以春天我们在 IMAX 电影院的显示屏旁边会有水桶，因为屋顶漏水了。有一天，天气非常糟糕，它开始淹没在建筑物下面，进入我们的楼层。所以这是我们开始准备把沙袋放在我们的仓库周围，并试图阻止洪水。

> `[00:19:26]` By the way the other photo is our conference room with Y C we made every penny count. I went back to the basics as the founder of your company. It is always good to go back to the basics and it\'s always good to talk to your customers visited customers every single week.

`[00:19:26]` 顺便说一句，另一张照片是我们和 YC 的会议室，我们计算了每一分钱。作为贵公司的创始人，我回到了最基本的领域。回到最基本的地方总是很好的，而且每周和你的客户交谈都是很好的。

> `[00:19:56]` And I learned something. Y Combinator tells you to talk to your customers because it will help you test and iterate your product and it will help you find product market fit. What they don\'t tell you is that if you meet with your customers you\'ll learn you\'ll not only see what you\'re doing but you\'ll see why you\'re doing it. I thought our mission was to deliver home cooked food to busy people. That\'s what I said in the beginning of this presentation. But really that\'s what we do. That\'s our product spec and in fact it\'s very narrow what I learned from visiting people is I wasn\'t measuring my success by geste. If we completed the delivery to their house I was watching their reaction and their emotion and how they felt about the food. That\'s when I learned and uncovered our true mission which is why we do what we do and why people care about gobble and it\'s because we create moments of love. We create love through food once you find your mission. And your north star. And you said it in the right place. Everything falls into place we talked about ambition earlier ambition is very singular mission is shared ambition is not enough mission is the strength it takes to get through the trough of sorrow and all the way to product market fit.

`[00:19:56]` 我学到了一些东西。YCombinator 告诉您与客户交谈，因为它将帮助您测试和迭代您的产品，它将帮助您找到适合您的产品市场。他们不告诉你的是，如果你和你的顾客见面，你就会知道你不仅会看到你在做什么，你还会明白你为什么这么做。我以为我们的任务是给忙碌的人送回家的熟食。我在演讲开始时就是这么说的。但事实上我们就是这么做的。这是我们的产品规格，事实上，我从拜访别人那里学到的是，我没有用妊娠来衡量我的成功。如果我们完成了送到他们家的工作，我就会看到他们的反应，他们的情绪，以及他们对食物的感受。这就是我了解和发现我们真正的使命的时候，这就是为什么我们做我们所做的，为什么人们关心狼吞虎咽，这是因为我们创造了爱的时刻。一旦你找到你的使命，我们就通过食物创造爱。还有你的北极星。你在正确的地方说的。一切都落到实处了，我们早些时候谈过野心，野心是非常独特的，使命是共同的，使命是不够的，是它所需要的力量来度过悲伤的低谷，一路走到产品市场的契合。

> `[00:21:45]` Mission is something that I shared with these 10x hires who have stayed with our company through all the ups and downs. If you recruit people or convince people based upon ambition they will leave in the tough times.

`[00:21:45]` 使命是我和这些 10 倍的员工分享的，他们在公司度过了所有的起起落落。如果你招募一些人，或者说服那些基于抱负的人，他们就会在困难时期离开。

> `[00:22:01]` If you recruit people with your mission they will stay with you for the long just as we had found our mission.

`[00:22:01]` 如果你招募有你使命的人，他们就会和你在一起很长时间，就像我们找到我们的使命一样。

> `[00:22:13]` I had recruited our team and we were meeting with all these customers. One journalist came out with a article covering the entire food space this is what she wrote about. Gobble gobble was puttering about on the peninsula. With its paltry funding and its ever evolving business model she might as well have taken the sword put it in my heart and twisted it. This was the hardest thing for me to hear. And for our team to see but because of our mission. Some people on our team took it even lighter than I did and helped encourage me that we were really onto something and that we needed to compete with ourself and not with others focus on our customer and keep moving forward. That\'s what we did. When we visited customers we found that cooking takes way too much time and it\'s completely exhausting. Takeout takes no time but it doesn\'t feel good.

`[00:22:13]` 我招募了我们的团队，我们会见了所有这些客户。一位记者拿出了一篇覆盖整个食物空间的文章，这就是她所写的。狼吞虎咽地在半岛上闲逛。凭借其微薄的资金和不断演变的商业模式，她本可以拿出一把剑，把它插进我的心里，扭曲它。这是我最难听到的。让我们的团队去看看但是因为我们的使命。我们团队中的一些人认为它比我更轻，并帮助我意识到我们确实在做一些事情，我们需要与我们自己竞争，而不是与其他人竞争，专注于我们的客户，并继续前进。这就是我们所做的。当我们拜访顾客时，我们发现烹饪要花费太多的时间，而且完全是精疲力竭的。外卖不需要时间，但感觉不太好。

> `[00:23:29]` It was then that I worked with our Executive Chef Thomas Ritchie in our kitchen and I thought why can\'t there be something quick that feels really good.

`[00:23:29]` 就在那时，我和我们的行政主厨托马斯·里奇在我们的厨房里工作，我想为什么不能有一件很快就能让人感觉很好的东西。

> `[00:23:40]` And he said Well why don\'t you cook.

`[00:23:40]` 他说，你为什么不做饭呢？

> `[00:23:42]` And I said I\'m so busy cooking Indian food takes two hours to soak things overnight. Who has the time for that.

`[00:23:42]` 我说我忙着煮印度菜，一夜之间要泡上两个小时。谁有时间这么做呢？

> `[00:23:50]` And he taught me about the French culinary term me son plus it means everything in place. In practice at a restaurant every day the prep cooks and the sous chefs they come to work and they chop all the vegetables they marinate needs. They prep sauces so that when dinner service starts the executive chef has everything in place to cook dinner and just 10 to 15 minutes. I thought this concept was brilliant. So we\'ve tried to apply it to our families and we thought would they be willing to do a little work. This is me giving some of our first test kits to a TaskRabbit in our warehouse. You can see some barbecue Short Ribs and Barbecue sauce in a bean and a chicken marsala dinner kit in the pan we crossed our fingers. I was really enjoying that enjoying the experience and I wanted to see what our customers would say turns out they loved it enthusiasm was building on its own.

`[00:23:50]` 他教我关于法国烹饪术语，我的儿子，再加上它意味着一切到位。在一家餐馆里，每天都有预备厨师和厨师来工作，他们把腌制所需的所有蔬菜都切碎。他们准备调味酱汁，这样当晚餐服务开始时，行政主厨就可以准备好所有的东西来做饭，而且只要 10 到 15 分钟就可以了。我觉得这个概念很棒。所以我们试着把它应用到我们的家庭中，我们认为他们愿意做一些工作。这是我给我们仓库里的一个 Task 兔子第一批测试包。你可以看到一些烧烤，短排骨和烧烤沙司在豆子和鸡肉玛莎拉晚餐包在平底锅里，我们祈祷我们的手指。我真的很享受这段经历，我想看看我们的客户会说什么，他们喜欢它，热情是靠它自己建立起来的。

> `[00:25:00]` There was a groundswell on social media.

`[00:25:00]` 社交媒体上掀起了一股热潮。

> `[00:25:03]` They all started going up a referral started going up our reviews started going up and we had finally hit the promised land very quickly after that we switched our entire business to 10 minute dinner kits. We knew we had invented a new way of cooking something that people would really enjoy. We had no marketing person on our team and we grew from zero to millions of dollars per year in a car in just less than one year and we were able to finally raise our series A round that I had worked so hard on with Andriessen Horowitz and Trinity ventures both of these firms.

`[00:25:03]` 他们都开始上升，推荐人开始上升，我们的评论开始上升，我们终于很快到达了应许之地，之后我们把整个生意都换成了 10 分钟的晚餐包。我们知道我们发明了一种新的烹饪方法，人们会很喜欢的。我们的团队中没有营销人员，在不到一年的时间里，我们在一辆汽车上的收入从零增长到了数百万美元，我们终于能够提高我们的 A 季，我和安德里森·霍洛维茨和三一风投公司都非常努力。

> `[00:25:56]` Both of these firms had rejected me in both previous rounds. It\'s important to play the long game with your startup and recognize that these relationships are not just for now but forever because you may be coming back to the exact same people that you met earlier. At another point in your journey this is our team today. This is a photo from Thanksgiving of last year. I can\'t wait for thanksgiving this year we expect it to be three times as big. It\'s our biggest company event and we invite all of our employees plus their family their friends and their kids outside of our company. We have customers who\'ve now been using us for eight weeks. This is one of those customers she told me that gobble saved her marriage cooking with her husband. Everyday is their moment to put the phone down.

`[00:25:56]` 这两家公司在前两轮都拒绝了我。重要的是与你的创业公司进行长期博弈，并认识到这些关系不仅是目前的，而且是永远的，因为你可能会回到你之前遇到的完全相同的人身边。在你们的另一个旅程中，这是我们今天的团队。这是去年感恩节的照片。我等不及今年的感恩节了，我们预计感恩节会是感恩节的三倍。这是我们最大的公司活动，我们邀请我们所有的员工，他们的家人，他们的朋友和他们的孩子离开我们的公司。我们的客户已经用了我们八个星期了。这是其中一位顾客，她告诉我，“狼吞虎咽”挽救了她和丈夫一起做饭的婚姻。每天都是他们放下电话的时刻。

> `[00:26:52]` Do something simple and feel what it really means to be a family.

`[00:26:52]` 做一件简单的事情，感受成为一个家庭的真正意义。

> `[00:27:01]` Other families like that of Lerato girl goes. She lives in Fremont. She said that her life used to be like groundhog day every day. She would come home and she would have to start cooking then do the dishes then get ready for the next day. Put her kids to bed and she never had any time to spend with her family. Now she has an hour to play with her beautiful daughter Olivia everyday and Olivia is a total boss.

`[00:27:01]` 像 Lerato 女孩那样的其他家庭都去了。她住在弗里蒙特。她说她的生活过去每天都像土拨鼠一样。她将回家，她将开始做饭，然后洗碗，然后为第二天做好准备。让她的孩子上床睡觉，她从来没有时间和家人在一起。现在她每天都有一个小时的时间和她美丽的女儿奥利维亚玩耍，奥利维亚是个十足的老板。

> `[00:27:26]` She gets home and she puts on fairy wings to do anything she wants to do.

`[00:27:26]` 她回到家，穿上仙女翅膀，做她想做的任何事。

> `[00:27:34]` Some people ask me how I got through all of this.

`[00:27:34]` 有些人问我这一切是怎么熬过来的。

> `[00:27:36]` Laughter laughs I wish it was that easy.

`[00:27:36]` 笑声我真希望那是那么简单。

> `[00:27:48]` I have three takeaways for you. The first is great grit comes from your core.

`[00:27:48]` 我有三个外卖给你。第一个是伟大的勇气来自你的核心。

> `[00:27:59]` This is a painting of one of my friends Bernadette Kaye in San Francisco grit is your ability to keep going even when it hurts.

`[00:27:59]` 这是一幅我朋友贝尔纳黛特·凯伊的画，在旧金山的贝纳黛特·凯(BernadetteKaye)，即使在受伤的时候，你也能坚持下去。

> `[00:28:14]` Your body and your mission will energize you at those really tough moments and will let you keep going. If you allow it we had so many moments where I felt so alone. But our mission and our team strengthened me and I know it will do the same for you. The next is to experiment. We went through four different models with lots of little experiments along the way in order to be where we are today. Product market fit is not just an aha moment. Its the summation of lots of broad experiments and micro learnings over many many many years.

`[00:28:14]` 你的身体和你的使命会在那些真正艰难的时刻激励你，让你继续前进。如果你允许的话，我们有那么多的时刻，我感到如此孤独。但是我们的任务和我们的团队加强了我，我知道这也会对你起同样的作用。下一个是实验。为了达到今天的水平，我们经历了四种不同的模型，并进行了大量的小实验。产品市场的适配不仅仅是一个时刻。这是多年来大量广泛的实验和微观经验的总结。

> `[00:29:01]` And last but absolutely not least is mission figuring out your mission will allow you to approach everything and everyone.

`[00:29:01]` 最后，但绝对重要的是，任务的确定将允许你接近每件事和每一个人。

> `[00:29:12]` Investor employee or friend with something to give them. It\'s very important for you to give with your startup so it can grow to be beyond you and grow to be a long term lasting and meaningful company.

`[00:29:12]` 投资者、雇员或朋友有东西给他们。对你来说，放弃创业非常重要，这样它就能超越你，成为一个长期、持久和有意义的公司。

> `[00:29:30]` Have grit in your core have experiments in your head and have your mission in your heart and you will be successful. Thank you.

`[00:29:30]` 有勇气在你的核心，在你的头脑里有实验，在你的心中有你的使命，你就会成功。谢谢。

> `[00:29:40]` Applause. 

`[00:29:40]` 掌声。
