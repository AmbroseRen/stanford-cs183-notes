# Chad Rigetti at Startup School SV 2016

\[00:00:00\] And everybody. Our next speaker is Chadrick getit from McGeady quantum computing Righetti quantum computing and went through Y C in the summer of 2014. At that point they had nothing. They are now one of the leading quantum computing companies in the world. And next year well I don\'t know exactly what they are getting close to a quantum supremacy machine. I have a particular love for the startups where they\'re trying to do something. It\'s not clear if it\'s technically possible but if they do it change the world and it just goes nothing nothing nothing nothing. And then everything is different. These companies are super fun to work with. And I think they\'re super fun to work on which is why I\'m so excited. Chad\'s here to tell us about Righetti and also hard technology startups in general and why it\'s OK. If you don\'t have a growth graph every week sometimes you just work and work and work and then everything comes together. Check them out here because I have a question for you.  

\[00:00:00\] 和大家。下一位发言者是来自 McGeady 量子计算公司的 Chadrick Getit，他在 2014 年夏天经历了 YC。那时他们一无所有。他们现在是世界上领先的量子计算公司之一。明年，嗯，我不知道他们到底在接近一台量子至上机器。我对创业公司有一种特别的爱，他们想在那里做点什么。目前还不清楚这在技术上是否可行，但如果他们这样做了，世界就会改变，一切就一事无成了。然后一切都变了。与这些公司合作非常有趣。我认为他们工作非常有趣，这也是为什么我如此兴奋的原因。查德来这里是为了告诉我们关于 Righetti 和硬技术初创公司的一般情况，以及为什么这样做是可以的。如果你没有每周的增长图表，有时你只是工作，然后一切都在一起。看看这里，因为我有个问题要问你。

\[00:00:58\] So Chad and I met on the streets of San Francisco and I walked around the financial district in 2014 and chatted. It started this company was thinking about it and Chad I\'ve actually never spoken about this again but I think I hope you remember this. I think Chad thought I was really crazy because we got into a long conversation about this simulation hypothesis and if a building a quantum computer was actually bad. Because it would use a lot of resources to emulate and shut down the simulation do you think I was really crazy.  于是，查德和我在旧金山的街道上相遇，2014 年，我在金融区四处闲逛，聊了聊。它开始的时候，这家公司正在考虑这个问题，查德，我从来没有说过这件事，但我想我希望你能记住这一点。我认为查德认为我真的疯了，因为我们就这个模拟假设进行了长时间的对话，如果一台量子计算机的建造真的很糟糕的话。因为它会使用大量的资源来模拟和关闭模拟，你认为我真的疯了吗？

\[00:01:29\] It was a very interesting conversation.

\[00:01:29\] 这是一次非常有趣的谈话。

\[00:01:31\] Laughter.

\[00:01:31\] 笑声。

\[00:01:33\] Is that like you know and as you can say yes I didn\'t think you\'re crazy but I had just moved to San Francisco into Silicon Valley from New York City. And that is not a conversation you can have in New York City without people thinking you\'re crazy. Laughter But I\'m an open person and I like to learn. So I was very interested in this hypothesis and it was an amazing conversation. It was really fun.

\[00:01:33\] 就像你所知道的，你可以说是的，我不认为你疯了，但我刚从纽约市搬到旧金山去硅谷。在纽约市，你不可能在人们认为你疯了的情况下进行这样的对话。笑，但我是一个开放的人，我喜欢学习。所以我对这个假设很感兴趣，这是一次很棒的对话。真的特好玩

\[00:01:54\] All right well I hope the company works and I hope the simulation is not shut down. Great thank you. That will help. All right. So Chad is going to talk to us about getti. Thank you for coming. Awesome. Thank you so much Sam.

\[00:01:54\] 好吧，我希望公司能运作，我希望模拟不会被关闭。太好了，谢谢。那会有帮助的。好的所以查德要和我们谈谈格蒂的事。谢谢你的光临。太棒了。非常感谢山姆。

\[00:02:10\] Applause.

\[00:02:10\] 掌声。

\[00:02:11\] All right. I\'m incredibly excited to be here today and to talk with you guys.

\[00:02:11\] 好的。我很高兴今天能来这里和你们谈谈。

\[00:02:17\] I\'m also incredibly honored. So thank you very much Sam and Cat NYC for having me. Give me the opportunity to talk with you guys so this I mentioned when we joined Y Combinator in summer 2014. We had nothing. We had not built a single Cubitt the fundamental building block of Acorda computer. We did not know how we were going to build cubits. I knew what they needed to look like and I knew what the fundamental requirements were. In fact I\'d been working in the fields for already about 10 or 12 years in quantum computing. And this is a five cubic corner computer that we have built at Righetti computing. It\'s less than two years later and we\'re about 35 people in a warehouse in Berkeley about 20 somePh.D. and we\'re building contributors and we\'re in a race to define this technology for the next 20 30 40 years and it\'s incredibly fun.

\[00:02:17\] 我也非常荣幸。所以非常感谢山姆和凯特纽约邀请我。给我机会和你们谈谈，这是我在 2014 年夏天加入 Y Combinator 时提到的。我们什么都没有。我们还没有建造一个立方体，这是 Acorda 计算机的基本组成部分。我们不知道怎样建造肘。我知道他们需要什么样子，我也知道基本要求是什么。事实上，我已经在量子计算领域工作了 10 到 12 年。这是我们在 Righetti 计算机公司建造的一台五立方角计算机。不到两年后，我们在伯克利的一个仓库里大约有 35 人-大约 20 岁左右-博士，我们正在建造贡献者，我们正在竞相在接下来的 20、30、40 年中定义这项技术，这是一种令人难以置信的乐趣。

\[00:03:18\] It is the kind of thing that gets you up in the morning and is worth spending your life on humans are building.

\[00:03:18\] 这是一种能让你在早晨起床的东西，值得你把你的生命花在人类正在建造的建筑上。

\[00:03:29\] Humans have been building tools and technology to store and process information for millennia. I\'d like to think of the sundial as the original computer. It takes an input and it tells us something useful with it and tells you the time from the sundial to the abacus and then things like that Babbage Difference Engine which you can go see at the Computer History Museum. It\'s amazing and you should do it to punch cards. Those are all systems based on Newtonian mechanics. And every time our understanding of nature evolves and develops further we add a deeper level of understanding. Our technology progresses as well. So many great companies were born of this first transition that I\'m talking about on the slide. IBM started as a computing Tabulating Recording Company. They made punch punch cards and time clocks. They were kind of born out of this first transition into the microchip era. And they say know they blossomed and evolved and survived through that through this time to grow into a very very large company. Other companies that drove that first transition.

\[00:03:29\] 几千年来，人类一直在建造工具和技术来存储和处理信息。我想把日晷当成原来的电脑。它需要一个输入，它告诉我们一些有用的东西，告诉你从日晷到算盘的时间，然后是巴贝奇差分引擎，你可以在计算机历史博物馆看到。这太棒了，你应该用它来打卡。这些都是基于牛顿力学的系统。每一次我们对自然的理解进化和发展的时候，我们都会增加一个更深层次的理解。我们的技术也在进步。这么多伟大的公司诞生在这第一次转型中，我在幻灯片上谈到了这一点。IBM 最初是一家电脑词汇记录公司。他们制作打孔卡和时刻表。他们是在第一次向微芯片时代过渡的过程中诞生的。他们说，他们知道，他们开花，进化，并通过这段时间生存下来，成长为一个非常大的公司。其他推动第一次转型的公司。

\[00:04:30\] Q Was it Fairchild intel. And then what\'s been born in that area of the microchip. Well almost everything we see around us driven the global economy for the past 50 or 60 years.

\[00:04:30\] 问：是费尔柴尔德的情报吗？然后，在微芯片的那个领域诞生了什么呢？嗯，在过去的 50 或 60 年里，我们所看到的几乎所有的一切都推动了全球经济的发展。

\[00:04:44\] That\'s incredible the amount of leverage you can get from a computing technology is massive. And you know what we\'ve known since 1985 that beneath is Newton\'s laws on one hand and then beneath that there is kind of Maxwell\'s equations and we\'ve known since 1985 that there\'s a more fundamental description of nature and that\'s quantum mechanics. At Righetti computing we\'re driving this next transition from microchips to the systems based on individual atoms or artificial atoms that we build in the lab. And that\'s a very exciting opportunity for for us so why is it worth doing this.

\[00:04:44\] 令人难以置信的是，你可以从一种计算技术中获得巨大的杠杆效应。你知道自 1985 年以来我们知道的是牛顿定律，在牛顿定律下面，有某种麦克斯韦方程，我们从 1985 年开始就知道，自然界有一个更基本的描述，这是量子力学的一个更基本的描述。在 Righetti 计算中，我们正在推动下一次从微芯片向基于单个原子或人工原子的系统的转变，这是我们在实验室中构建的。这对我们来说是一个非常令人兴奋的机会，所以为什么值得这样做呢？

\[00:05:20\] This sounds incredibly hard. Why is it worth trying to build contributors in the first place. Well the kind of problems that these machines will solve are incredibly impactful.

\[00:05:20\] 这听起来很难。为什么值得一开始就建立贡献者呢？这些机器所能解决的问题是非常有影响的。

\[00:05:32\] They fall into two broad categories. We think of them in kind of two broad categories. On the one hand you have a class of applications that we think of as quantum chemistry. So what you\'re doing in this case is using the quantum mechanical the quantum computer as a tool to investigate other quantum mechanical systems. It turns out that that\'s almost everything in science medicine material science. This is stuff that is going to lead to better drugs better materials better nuclear reactors highly impactful technology. Why are we doing this. Because if you can you build a quantum computer you can do a simulation driven design of new catalysts catalysts to capture carbon or nitrogen from the atmosphere. It can help solve global warming. This is an incredible incredibly broad technology. The other bucket of applications is machine learning and artificial intelligence. So in this case what you do is learn to embed a learning problem on a classically intractable physical model that you can simulate on a quantum computer. That\'s a mouthful. What it means is quantum computers are going to lead a fundamentally more powerful forms of artificial intelligence.

\[00:05:32\] 它们分为两大类。我们把它们分为两大类。一方面，你有一类我们认为是量子化学的应用。在这种情况下，你所做的就是使用量子力学，量子计算机，作为研究其他量子力学系统的工具。事实证明，这几乎是科学、医学、材料科学中的一切。这将导致更好的药物、更好的材料、更好的核反应堆、高影响力的技术。我们为什么要这么做。因为如果你能建造一台量子计算机，你就可以进行模拟驱动的设计，设计新的催化剂，从大气中捕获碳或氮。它可以帮助解决全球变暖问题。这是一项令人难以置信的广泛技术。另一桶应用是机器学习和人工智能。所以在这种情况下，你要做的是学会把学习问题嵌入到一个经典的棘手的物理模型上，你可以在量子计算机上模拟这个模型。那是一口。这意味着量子计算机将引领一种从根本上更强大的人工智能形式。

\[00:06:42\] So when I say more powerful what do I mean. Does anyone recognize this. It\'s on the slide. So this is Tianmei to this is until about three months ago was the most powerful computer on the planet. It cost about 400 million dollars it burns about 20 megawatts of electricity.

\[00:06:42\] 所以当我说更有力量的时候，我的意思是。有人认识这个吗。它在下滑。所以这是天美，直到大约三个月前，它还是地球上最强大的计算机。它花费了 4 亿美元，它消耗了大约 20 兆瓦的电力。

\[00:07:06\] Governor how much electricity that is enough to it\'s enough to power about its enough to power the town I grew up in. About 20000 households it\'s about half the size of a football field.

\[00:07:06\] 州长，有多少电力足够让我长大的小镇供电，大约有 20000 户，大约是足球场面积的一半。

\[00:07:24\] It\'s based on three point two million Intel cores. So there\'s two problems with this. Ultimately our approach to building large scale computers is starting to break. And there\'s two problems the first is that Moore\'s Law is ending. That\'s been happening for a long time lateral transistor scaling the fundamental measure of Moore\'s Law has sort of leveled off for the past eight years. The other thing is something that I hope you\'ve all heard about in your computer science class is called Abduls law on US law talks about the limiting benefits the diminishing returns of parallelization. These are massively parallel machines. Three point two million cores running in parallel only problems that can be paralyzed run fast on these kinds of machines.

\[00:07:24\] 它基于三百二十万英特尔核心。这有两个问题。最终，我们建造大规模计算机的方法开始瓦解。有两个问题，第一个问题是摩尔定律即将结束。这种情况已经发生了很长一段时间，横向晶体管定标-摩尔定律的基本测量-在过去八年里已经趋于平稳。另一件事，我希望你们在你们的计算机科学课上都听说过，叫做 AbdulsLaw，关于美国法律，谈论的限制利益，递减的平行回报。这些都是大规模的并行机器。320 万个核心并行运行，只有那些可以瘫痪的问题，才能在这类机器上快速运行。

\[00:08:06\] There\'s a fundamentally better way. Now President Obama has shown some significant vision in driving a return of American leadership and high performance computing and he ESET said that America is going to build an extra scale computer something about 30 times more powerful than China had to. By 2020 that machine will cost about a billion dollars with current technology and it would require a nuclear power plant to run it.

\[00:08:06\] 有一个根本上更好的方法。现在，奥巴马总统在推动美国领导力和高性能计算机的回归方面展现了一些重要的愿景。他说，美国将建造一台额外规模的计算机，这是中国的 30 倍左右。到 2020 年，这台机器的现有技术将耗资约 10 亿美元，需要一座核电站来运行。

\[00:08:35\] We\'re

\[00:08:35\] 我们

\[00:08:35\] gonna do it and we need to.

\[00:08:35\] 我们必须这么做。

\[00:08:38\] But

\[00:08:38\] 但是

\[00:08:38\] there is another path ultimately when you can compute with quantum physics you have a faster and cheaper path to that level of computing power. How is that possible. Well these are two developmental systems in our lab in Berkeley. These are what you see in the big white cans are cooling systems every high performance computer has a cooling system. These ones are very powerful these round the low temperature inside each of those cooling systems is a single chip. When this picture was taken we had a five cubic processor in that machine a single chip with about 60 or 70 cubits on it would be more powerful the entire half a football field sized sized machine. That\'s what corner computing unlocks.

\[00:08:38\] 当你能用量子物理学计算的时候，还有另一条路径，你有一条更快更便宜的途径达到这个计算能力的水平。这怎么可能。这是我们伯克利实验室的两个发展系统。这些都是你在大白罐里看到的冷却系统，每台高性能的电脑都有一个冷却系统。这些是非常强大的，这些周围的低温，每个冷却系统是一个单一的芯片。当这张照片被拍下来的时候，我们在那台机器里有一个 5 立方的处理器，一片 60 或 70 英尺左右的芯片，它的功能会更强大，整个半个足球场大小的机器。这就是角落计算解锁的地方。

\[00:09:23\] So this is a true hard tech startup and one of the challenges that hard tech companies all talk about this more in a moment brings is this challenge of operating in a in an arena that is not well-defined that does not have a well-developed supply chain you know what you want to do but the capabilities to do it do not exist or are not commercially or are easily accessible. We\'ve had to develop all of the building blocks entire supply chain for this technology. What does that mean for us. We have developed a new new simulation driven design methods to actually develop design. These quantum chips. We develop our own fab our own micro fabrication capability. We\'ve developed advanced electronics that allow you to control these. These chips you can think of a quantum computer or something like a nuclear reactor where you have the core the new you know where the reaction is happening that generates all the power. But then there\'s this really complex traditional engineering system around that stabilized that it extracts a computational capability. And that thing is very expensive and requires very advanced control of Onix and then ultimately we have access to these machines over the cloud. And so we have to have cloud software and applications and a lot of work. There\'s a lot of different things you\'ve got to tie together in one organisation to do this. This slide is frankly a synthesis of the past 15 years of my life. I\'ve been working on this problem my entire adult life. I was a junior in college in Saskatchewan Canada and. Really that\'s amazing.

\[00:09:23\] 这是一家真正艰难的科技初创公司，困难的科技公司都会在一瞬间更多地谈论到这一点，其中一个挑战就是在一个没有明确定义的、没有完善供应链的环境中运营，你知道你想做什么，但做这件事的能力不存在，或者商业上不存在，或者很容易获得。我们必须为这项技术开发整个供应链的所有组成部分。这对我们意味着什么。我们开发了一种新的仿真驱动设计方法来实际开发设计。这些量子芯片。我们发展自己的工厂，我们自己的微制造能力。我们开发了先进的电子产品，让你可以控制这些。这些芯片，你可以想象一台量子计算机或者类似于核反应堆的东西，在那里你有核心，新的，你知道反应在哪里发生，产生所有的能量。但是，还有一个非常复杂的传统工程系统，它稳定地提取了计算能力。这种设备非常昂贵，需要对 Onix 进行非常先进的控制，最终我们可以通过云端访问这些机器。因此，我们必须拥有云软件和应用程序，以及大量的工作。为了做到这一点，你必须把许多不同的东西结合在一个组织中。坦率地说，这张幻灯片是我生命中过去 15 年的综合。我成年后一直在研究这个问题。我是加拿大萨斯喀彻温省大学三年级学生。真是太棒了。

\[00:10:54\] Laughter laughter Where are you from. Laughter.

\[00:10:54\] 笑声你来自哪里。笑声。

\[00:11:00\] Oh wow Mustafa here Mustafa. I was a junior at the University of Virginia Regina Saskatchewan Canada and a physics major. I was incredibly frustrated. I was very very frustrated. I didn\'t understand two basic things that I thought every human on the planet should understand what\'s quantum physics and how do computers actually work.

\[00:11:00\] 哦，哇，穆斯塔法，这里是穆斯塔法。我当时就读于加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的弗吉尼亚大学(UniversityofVirginia)，主修物理。我非常沮丧。我很沮丧。我不理解两个基本的东西，我认为地球上的每个人都应该理解什么是量子物理，计算机是如何工作的。

\[00:11:26\] How do they actually store or process represent information. About the same time I read about a field called quantum computing. I like to synthesize things. I thought this was amazing. There is one field that I can learn instead of having to learn to this makes life so much easier.

\[00:11:26\] 它们如何实际存储或处理信息。大约在同一时间，我读到了一个叫做量子计算的领域。我喜欢合成东西。我觉得这太棒了。有一个领域，我可以学习，而不是必须学习，这使生活变得如此容易。

\[00:11:45\] I\'ve been working on that ever since and that was in 2001. I heard about these people at Yale University that had an idea for building Kornet computers. You can build these things out of real individual atoms or ions that\'s really hard because individual atoms are ions are extremely tiny and very very hard to control. They said why don\'t we build these things out of special electrical circuits based on superconductors that have no dissipation and build them in such a manner that they mimic real atoms build an artificial atom out of an electrical circuit like that. That\'s amazing. That\'s such a great idea because what\'s going to happen is you\'re gonna be able to leverage all of traditional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. You\'re gonna be able to build a scalable tech chip technology someday based on those superconducting cubits. I spent about seven years with those with that group at Yale as aPh.D. student a postdoc. I spent about three years in doing further research at IBM in quantum computing and in 2013 I started Righetti computing to develop quantum integrated circuits and that\'s what we\'ve done.

\[00:11:45\] 从 2001 年起，我就一直在研究这个问题。我听说耶鲁大学的这些人想要建造 Kornet 电脑。你可以用真正的单个原子或离子建造这些东西，这些原子或离子非常难，因为单个原子是非常微小的，而且很难控制。他们说，为什么我们不用没有耗散的超导体的特殊电路来建造这些东西，并以一种模仿真实原子的方式，用这样的电路来建造一个人造原子。太棒了。这真是个好主意，因为你将能够利用所有传统的半导体制造能力。有一天，你将能够建立一种可伸缩的技术芯片技术。我在耶鲁大学当博士后的时候和那个小组的学生一起呆了大约七年。我花了大约三年时间在 IBM 做量子计算方面的进一步研究，2013 年，我开始了 Righetti 计算，开发量子集成电路，这就是我们所做的。

\[00:12:54\] So this is the jump on my second slide.

\[00:12:54\] 这是我第二张幻灯片上的跳转。

\[00:12:57\] This is the leap from Newtonian plus Maxwell\'s equations to Newtonian plus Maxwell\'s equations plus Schrodinger\'s equations quantum physics and ultimately to offer you a working definition if there\'s any physics majors in the audience I want to give you a working definition of a quantum computer quantum computer store and process information in individual photons.

\[00:12:57\] 这是从牛顿+麦克斯韦方程到牛顿+麦克斯韦方程加上薛定谔方程、量子物理学的飞跃，并最终给你一个工作定义，如果听众中有物理专业，我想给你一个量子计算机存储和处理信息的工作定义。

\[00:13:17\] That\'s it your iPhone.

\[00:13:17\] 那是你的 iPhone。

\[00:13:23\] The iPhone 7 uses about 100 billion photons for a bit processed. It may be as much as 10 to the 17 and 100 billion photons per bit transmitted this is far more efficient technology.

\[00:13:23\] iPhone 7 使用了大约 1000 亿个光子来处理。它可能高达 10 到 1000 亿光子每比特传输，这是一个更有效的技术。

\[00:13:39\] Okay so I want to talk for a moment about the distinction between a hard tech company and a tech company. First of all when I say hard tech I don\'t mean it\'s harder. Although it feels harder. What we mean is every company and look at the companies on the sly. These are incredible organizations incredible incredible organizations incredible companies incredible products incredible founders.

\[00:13:39\] 好吧，我想谈一谈硬科技公司和科技公司之间的区别。首先，当我说硬科技的时候，我并不是说难度更大。尽管感觉很难。我们指的是每一家公司，偷偷地看看这些公司。这些是不可思议的组织，不可思议的公司，难以置信的产品，不可思议的创始人。

\[00:14:06\] These are all incredibly hard things there\'s one distinction a hard tech company has to deal with and include in addition to all of the tech execution Markovitz all the standard things all the gauntlet that you have to steerer your organization through to survive. Fundamental questions of possibility you have to deal with that when you\'re a hard tech company that is. That is the signature of a hard tech organization.

\[00:14:06\] 这些都是令人难以置信的困难之处-一个困难的科技公司必须处理的一个区别-除了所有的技术执行，马科维茨还包括所有你必须引导你的组织生存的挑战。当你是一家硬科技公司的时候，你必须面对这个根本的可能性问题。这是一个硬科技组织的标志。

\[00:14:36\] There\'s two things I want you to take away from this. The first is that well with all of that risk we\'re saying it might not even be possible. Why the hell are you going to do that. Why the hell is anyone going to invest in your company if it might not be possible to even do it.

\[00:14:36\] 有两件事我想让你从这件事中解脱出来。第一件事是，我们说这种风险很好，我们说它可能根本不可能。你为什么要这么做呢？如果你的公司不可能这样做，为什么还会有人投资你的公司呢？

\[00:14:56\] Why is it worth it. If you\'re not sure it\'s possible. Well there\'s two things you get from my perspective.

\[00:14:56\] 为什么值得这么做？如果你不确定这是可能的话。从我的角度来看，有两件事你可以得到。

\[00:15:03\] The first is if and when you are successful you create monumental leverage and defense ability. Think of the Manhattan Project as a canonical hard tech organization. Look at the fucking leverage they created.

\[00:15:03\] 第一个问题是，如果你成功了，你就创造了巨大的筹码和防御能力。把曼哈顿项目想象成一个典型的高科技组织。看看他们创造的杠杆。

\[00:15:17\] Laughter. That\'s incredible.

\[00:15:17\] 笑声。太不可思议了。

\[00:15:21\] The Apollo missions when President Kennedy said in 1961 as a nation we\'re going to put a American on the surface of the moon and return him safely to Earth by the close of this decade.

\[00:15:21\] 当肯尼迪总统在 1961 年说，作为一个国家，我们将把一名美国人送上月球，并在这十年结束前将他安全地送回地球。

\[00:15:38\] That was an important moment for mankind.

\[00:15:38\] 那是人类的一个重要时刻。

\[00:15:44\] That\'s the kind of story that isn\'t written in quarterly reports and spreadsheets that\'s written in here glyphs on cave walls that\'s the kind of stuff that stirs the heart that\'s what you get when you do a hard tech company and that is so powerful. Now I want you to notice something on this site.

\[00:15:44\] 这是一种没有写在季度报告和电子表格中的故事，而是写在洞穴墙壁上的铭文，这种东西让你在做一家艰难的科技公司时得到了什么，这是多么强大的东西。现在我想让你注意到这个网站上的一些东西。

\[00:16:05\] Look at these amazing companies at some point the defense ability and leverage that hard tech provides and the incredible passion that you engender by working on problems of that scope and impact leads organizations on the left to pushing into that into hard tech in order to access those things.

\[00:16:05\] 看看这些令人惊叹的公司在某一时刻的防御能力和杠杆，以及你通过努力解决这种范围和影响的问题而产生的难以置信的热情，这将引导左边的组织投入到硬技术中去，以获取这些东西。

\[00:16:29\] Think of Uber moving into self driving cars. Think of Google now 100 seedlings hoping to turn something into a long term defense ability. Microsoft builds software and has started working on quantum computing that\'s what you get with a hard tech company. Now there\'s also significant challenges and I want to talk about three of them for a moment. Team communication and integration. So first of all building an organization that has world\'s experts in X Y zie all of the things that you need to master as an organization is incredibly hard. It comes with its own set of challenges. You\'re going to have to interface to the best scientists and engineers on the planet in those various fields. You\'re going to hire them. You\'re going have to bring them all into one company and you\'re going to have to find a way to smash them to allow them to talk to each other under the roof of one organization. And that leads into this integration challenge.

\[00:16:29\] 想象一下优步进入自动驾驶汽车。想想谷歌现在的 100 棵幼苗，希望能把一些东西变成一种长期的防御能力。微软开发软件，并开始致力于量子计算，这是你从一家硬科技公司得到的。现在也有一些重大的挑战，我想谈一谈其中的三个。团队沟通和整合。因此，首先，建立一个拥有世界专家的组织，作为一个组织，你需要掌握的所有东西都是非常困难的。它带来了自己的一系列挑战。你将不得不与地球上最优秀的科学家和工程师在这些不同的领域进行交流。你要雇用他们。你必须把他们都带进一家公司，你必须想办法粉碎他们，让他们在一个组织的屋檐下互相交谈。这导致了整合的挑战。

\[00:17:35\] Integrating an organization that does all these disparate things we have people on the team. We have a Rhodes scholar who\'s been doing research in quantum computing for 10 years and is 27 years old. We have tenured physics faculty. We have someone teach in a course at Caltech who built the communication systems on the Mars rover missions. We have an incredible organization and one of the problems we\'ve solved it that we have people who can all have a conversation together because they all have developed a shared language. That level of integration becomes a long term weapon for your organization.

\[00:17:35\] 整合一个组织，完成所有这些不同的事情，我们团队中的人。我们有一位罗兹学者，他在量子计算领域做了 10 年的研究，现在已经 27 岁了。我们有终身物理教师。我们有一位加州理工学院的教师在火星漫游者的任务中建立了通讯系统。我们有一个令人难以置信的组织，也是我们解决的问题之一，我们有一些人可以一起交谈，因为他们都发展出了一种共同的语言。这种级别的集成将成为组织的长期武器。

\[00:18:11\] Huge amount of value can be created by now communication we\'re not doing this because quantum computing is interesting.

\[00:18:11\] 现在通讯可以创造出巨大的价值，我们没有这样做，因为量子计算很有趣。

\[00:18:24\] We\'re doing this to cure cancer and to solve global warming how you talk about what you do as an organization is incredibly impactful. I encourage you to spend a lot of time thinking about it. I did this a few years ago and I decided that our mission as an organization when there were three people in the company was we\'re on a mission to build the world\'s most powerful computer.

\[00:18:24\] 我们这样做是为了治愈癌症和解决全球变暖

\[00:18:47\] It gives you some of the sink your teeth into. It\'s a little more tangible than photons.

\[00:18:47\] 它让你的牙齿陷进了一些水槽。它比光子更有形。

\[00:18:53\] We did this exercise again in the in the past month with the team fully built out well partially built out at the stage and we got to the same thing.

\[00:18:53\] 在过去的一个月里，我们再次做了这个练习，我们的团队在舞台上完成了完全的、部分的、完善的训练，我们也做到了同样的事情。

\[00:19:05\] It\'s really amazing why are we doing it we\'re we\'re building the most powerful computers in the world to solve humanity\'s most important and pressing problems. That\'s a rallying cry that can be very impactful for your organization. Now the other thing you get with integration is the opportunity create all this defense ability. So the chip the quantum integrated circuit is one part of it that gives you an Intel kind of business for the computing narrow. We\'re not stopping at that because no one is competing at all these different levels today and we have an opportunity to build moats around the entire thing. The next layer up is to build the system become a master system integration. That\'s an IBM style business. And then ultimately don\'t the software and platform out in the Microsoft style business. Ultimately I want to go full stack and also include the Google style business of applications and designing new drugs to to save people\'s lives.

\[00:19:05\] 我们为什么要这么做呢？我们正在建造世界上最强大的计算机来解决人类最重要和最紧迫的问题。这是一种团结的呼声，对你的组织会产生很大的影响。现在，与集成的另一件事是机会，创造所有这些防御能力。所以芯片-量子集成电路-是其中的一部分，它为计算范围提供了英特尔的一种业务。我们不会就此止步，因为今天没有人在所有这些不同的层次上竞争，我们有机会围绕着整件事建造护城河。下一层是建立系统，使系统成为主系统的集成。那是 IBM 风格的生意。最后，不要把软件和平台放在微软风格的业务中。最终，我想要全力以赴，也包括谷歌(Google)式的应用程序业务，以及设计新的药物来拯救人们的生命。

\[00:19:55\] All right. So before we move on to this I want you I\'ll do some for me I want you to do this one thing for me I want you to take 10 minutes today.

\[00:19:55\] 好的。所以，在我们讨论这个之前，我要你帮我做一些，我要你为我做一件事，我想让你今天花 10 分钟的时间。

\[00:20:09\] After this at the break. When you go home during your meditation whatever you want to do I want you to take 10 minutes and look in your heart. I don\'t want you to ask yourself the question what kind of company do I want to join or found what kind of organization resonates with me. And when you do that spend that 10 minutes when you do that some small fraction of you it won\'t be many. Some small fraction of you will say you know what I want to do the thing that stirs my heart. I want to do the thing that calls to me that is worth spending your life on one last thing.

\[00:20:09\] 在这之后的休息时间。当你在冥想中回家时，无论你想做什么，我都希望你花 10 分钟的时间看看你的心。我不想让你问自己，我想加入什么样的公司，或者发现什么样的组织会引起我的共鸣。当你这样做的时候，花 10 分钟，当你做那件事的时候，你的一些小部分就不会太多了。你们中的一些人会说，你们知道我想做什么，这件事触动了我的心。我想做一件值得你在最后一件事上花费一生的事情。

\[00:20:47\] So one of the special challenges that a hard tech organization faces is the capabilities to do what you need to do don\'t exist if they existed it wouldn\'t be hard.

\[00:20:47\] 所以一个困难的技术组织所面临的特殊挑战之一是你所需要做的事情的能力-如果它们存在的话-它不会很难。

\[00:20:59\] Check organization so there\'s this tension that exists in all companies but is especially accentuated in hard tech attention between developing the product. Take your product from concept to market get the product built ship the product with the things you need to do to enable that at each successive stage of evolution company development build the capabilities and create organizational clarity. That\'s your job as a founder and a leader. What should you work on found that there is a useful framework. I thought about this problem for a really long time because I was spending every day trying to balance these two competing tensions ultimately these are both processes of pumping entropy out of the system. You have an idea for the product. I know what this Cornick Peter wants to look like. It\'s all you know. But it doesn\'t exist it doesn\'t exist yet. There\'s all these questions we have to answer. I think when you starts basically an idea from what this rocket was going to look like there\'s a gazillion micro decisions that have to be made to actually manifest that thing in the real world. That is a process of pumping entropy out of the vision.

\[00:20:59\] 检查组织，以便所有公司都存在这种紧张关系，但在开发产品之间的艰难的技术关注中尤为突出。把你的产品从一个概念带到另一个市场，让产品建立起来，用你需要做的事情来运送产品，以便在公司发展的每一个后续阶段，建立能力，并创建清晰的组织。这是你作为创始人和领导者的工作。你应该做什么工作，发现有一个有用的框架。我思考这个问题已经很长时间了，因为我每天都在试图平衡这两种相互竞争的紧张关系，最终这些都是将熵从系统中抽出来的过程。你对这个产品有个想法。我知道这个科尼克·彼得想要什么样子。你只知道这些。但它还不存在。我们必须回答所有这些问题。我想，当你从火箭的样子开始的时候，需要做出无数的微观决定，才能在现实世界中真正体现出这一点。这是一个将熵从视觉中抽出来的过程。

\[00:22:02\] Same with company development creating this organizational clarity building the capabilities answering the question are we going to do our own fab or we\'re going to outsource. We\'re going to partner with IBM to the Fabra we\'re going to how we can do the fab we have to answer that question. Ultimately that is a process of pumping HP of the system. There\'s a lot of things that this leads to one is it tells you who you should hire.

\[00:22:02\] 同样，随着公司的发展，创造组织的清晰性，建立解决问题的能力，我们是自己动手，还是外包。我们将与 IBM 合作到 Fabra，我们将讨论如何做我们必须回答的问题。最终，这是一个泵惠普系统的过程。这导致了很多事情，其中之一就是它告诉你应该雇佣谁。

\[00:22:24\] Some people create order and clarity in their wake. They create systems they execute systems they reinforce systems they train other people how to use those systems.

\[00:22:24\] 有些人在身后创造秩序和清晰。他们创建系统，执行系统，加强系统，培训其他人如何使用这些系统。

\[00:22:36\] Other people generate entropy know what you\'re looking for hire people who pump entropy out of your vision for your organization. It\'s incredibly powerful so this is one of my favorite pictures I\'ve ever seen. This is a picture of the control data Corporation. Sixty six hundred machine what I love about it is look clergy it is. There\'s wires hanging out of this thing everywhere you can see the pumps down in the corner.

\[00:22:36\] 其他人产生熵，知道你在找什么人，谁把熵从你的组织愿景中抽出来。它非常强大，所以这是我见过的我最喜欢的照片之一。这是控制数据公司的图片。六百台机器我最喜欢的是神职人员。这个东西上挂着电线，到处都可以看到角落里的水泵。

\[00:23:06\] This machine was the is widely considered the first supercomputer the United States blocked the export of one of these things to our allies in France.

\[00:23:06\] 这台机器被广泛认为是第一台超级计算机，美国阻止了这些东西出口到我们在法国的盟友。

\[00:23:20\] It was incredibly impactful at a geopolitical level. And who built it. A group of 34 folks in the woods of Wisconsin 34 people built the world\'s most powerful computer. I can\'t even read the memo. It\'s too powerful.

\[00:23:20\] 在地缘政治层面上，这是非常有影响的。以及是谁建造的。威斯康星州森林里的 34 个人建造了世界上最强大的电脑。我连备忘录都看不清。它太强大了。

\[00:23:42\] Ultimately 34 people compete in a giant behemoth that is what happens in high performance computing. That is what happens with a lot of hard tech organizations and it\'s an incredible opportunity for you. If this pulls at your heartstrings. Thank you very much. Applause. 

\[00:23:42\] 最终有 34 人在一个巨大的庞然大物中竞争，这就是高性能计算中所发生的事情。这就是很多困难的技术组织所发生的事情，这对你来说是一个令人难以置信的机会。如果这牵动了你的心弦。非常感谢。掌声。
