# Office Hours with Kevin Hale and Qasar Younis at Startup School SV 2016

> `[00:00:05]` Dramatic entrance was easy easily placeable crowd.

`[00:00:05]` 戏剧性的入场是很容易对付的人群。

> `[00:00:16]` We have a favor to ask of all of you guys out there how many people follow JUSTIN ON SNAPCHAT. All right. Great. So Justin\'s not here.

`[00:00:16]` 我们想请在座的各位，有多少人在 Snapchat 上跟踪贾斯汀。好的太棒了贾斯汀不在这里

> `[00:00:27]` But there should be punishment for there should be punishment for that. So just send him a message if everybody sends a message right now. It\'s going to completely mess up his phone a few hundred messages to Justin right now would be appreciated. We\'ll give you ten seconds. Kastor says hi. Ok so my name is Casser UNICE.

`[00:00:27]` 但这应该受到惩罚。所以只要现在每个人都给他发个信息就行了。它会把他的电话搞得一团糟，现在就给贾斯汀几百条短信。我们给你十秒钟。卡斯特向你问好。好的，我叫卡塞尔·尤尼斯(Casser Unice)。

> `[00:00:45]` I\'m one of the partners there. We don\'t have a clicker. Clickety click. That\'s Kevin Hill. He\'s one of the other partners here. Why see one of the things that we do at why you\'re one of the kind of core things you do see is office hours. And there are three types of office hours we do in the program. The first is individual office hours where a partner will sit down with you and talk about a specific problem that the company has and really dive in deeply. And that\'s going to emulate here onstage stage. Today most of the partners are using their own experiences as being founders and being engineers or whatever the problem might be to help kind of solve that problem. One of the things that I say in a lot of partners is when I\'m giving advice I don\'t tell you or the companies that will be up here what they should do. I can only tell what I would do if I was in your position. And obviously we\'re different people the founders who were running companies are different from us different context and different experiences. So it just ends up being a blueprint of how to solve from one from another person\'s problem. So anyways individual offers are something we do. We also do this thing called group office hours where multiple partners will sit together and then six or seven startups will sit together we do a biweekly. When you\'re in NYC and then the third type of office hours we do are external office hours will bring an apple or bring in Android to help with the app storesetc. So today we\'re emulating the first time. Now couple of key points here is this is kind of a bad example because we don\'t do them on stage in front of hundreds of thousands of people. So naturally this kind of presentation is slightly awkward for that reason. Number two is we tend to be pretty direct in office hours and obviously doing in front of a group of people is where we\'re gonna kind of temper had a little bit. And I also want to just in advance think the startups who are kind of brave enough out here to talk through the problems that they\'re having with us.

`[00:00:45]` 我是那里的合伙人之一。我们没有按键。陈词滥调的点击。那是凯文·希尔。他是这里的其他合伙人之一。为什么要看到我们所做的事情之一，为什么你是你所看到的核心事物之一，那就是办公时间。我们在节目中有三种办公时间。第一个是个人的办公时间，在那里，一个合伙人会和你坐下来，谈论公司的一个具体问题，并真正深入地研究这个问题。这将在舞台上模仿。如今，大多数合伙人都在利用自己作为创始人和工程师的经验来帮助解决这个问题。我在很多合作伙伴中说过的一件事是，当我给出建议时，我不会告诉你或者那些在这里的公司该做什么。我只能说，如果我处在你的位置，我会怎么做。很明显，我们是不同的人，管理公司的创始人与我们不同，不同的背景和不同的经历。因此，它最终只是一个如何从另一个人的问题中解决问题的蓝图。所以不管怎么说，个人报价都是我们做的事情。我们还做了一件叫做小组办公时间的事情，多位合伙人坐在一起，然后六、七家初创公司坐在一起，我们每两周做一次。当你在纽约的时候，我们做的第三种办公时间是外部办公时间，它会带来一个苹果，或者引入 Android 来帮助应用程序的开发等等。所以今天我们第一次模仿。这里有几个关键点，这是一个很糟糕的例子，因为我们不会在成千上万的人面前在舞台上这样做。因此，出于这个原因，这种表达方式自然会有些尴尬。第二，我们在办公时间往往很直接，显然在一群人面前做的事情会让我们有点脾气。我也想提前想一想，那些创业公司在这里有足够的勇气来讨论他们和我们在一起遇到的问题。

> `[00:02:39]` So thanks and apologies in advance.

`[00:02:39]` 所以请提前致谢并道歉。

> `[00:02:44]` I don\'t think 90 percent of you guys out there volunteer to like do office hours on stage with us.

`[00:02:44]` 我不认为你们 90%的人愿意和我们一起在舞台上做办公时间。

> `[00:02:50]` So like I\'m super delighted that you guys gave us opportunity to look at sort of like all the ideas you\'re working on.

`[00:02:50]` 所以我很高兴你们给了我们机会，让我们看看你们正在研究的所有想法。

> `[00:02:56]` And then one last point is these are these are not pitches. So we\'re actually you know we\'re going to try to avoid from going into what do do and why is it so great much more and kind of diving into a problem. We actually are doing a pitch section afterwards so you\'ll see how that\'s how that\'s different because that\'s office hours.

`[00:02:56]` 最后一点是，这些不是投球。所以我们实际上，你知道，我们要尽量避免去做什么，为什么会有这么大的问题，为什么会有更多更大的问题。我们实际上是在做一个演讲部分，这样你就会发现那有多大的不同，因为那是办公时间的一部分。

> `[00:03:13]` Three companies that we picked today. We did on a theme. This is all that different from other times that we\'ve done this. All three companies are marketplace companies. And the reason we pick that is because they\'re very different kind of startup when you\'re working with them. So most companies when you work with it well you\'ll notice that like it\'s tends not to be a zero sum game. So they\'re usually in any space there can be multiple winners but in a marketplace kind of play it tends to be one kind of company tends to end up dominating over everyone else. And the thing is like when you can make that happen that can make you very very large and very very lucrative and investors get very excited about marketplaces. The category that we\'ve seen actually lots of different investment firms and people are very interested in very specifically. That being said they work a little bit different in terms of how you work with them and tends to be always kind of the similar kind of approach. You try to identify what supply what demand what side you\'re going to be working on. So we\'re going to see this kind of thematic thing where all three of them even though they\'re very different companies have very similar approaches in terms of how we ask questions how we think about their problems and how we should go from there. That\'s it. Let\'s rock and roll first company is traveling spume it\'s good man. All right.

`[00:03:13]` 我们今天挑选的三家公司。我们做的是一个主题。这一切都与其他时候不同，我们已经这样做了。这三家公司都是市场公司。我们之所以选择这样做，是因为当你和他们一起工作的时候，他们是非常不同的创业公司。因此，大多数公司，当你很好地处理它时，你会注意到，喜欢它，往往不是零和游戏。因此，他们通常在任何地方，有可能有多个赢家，但在一个市场类型的游戏，它往往是一种类型的公司往往最终主宰其他人。事情是这样的，当你能做到这一点时，你就会变得非常庞大，利润也非常丰厚，投资者对市场非常兴奋。我们所看到的这个类别实际上是很多不同的投资公司和人们非常感兴趣的。话虽如此，但在你如何与他们合作方面，他们的工作方式有点不同，而且往往是一种类似的方法。你试着找出什么供给，什么需求，你将在哪一边工作。因此，我们将看到这样的主题，尽管它们都是非常不同的，但公司在如何提问、我们如何看待它们的问题以及我们应该如何解决它们的问题方面有着非常相似的方法。就这样了。让我们摇滚乐第一，公司是旅行的动力，它是个好人。好的

> `[00:04:22]` A warm welcome welcome.

`[00:04:22]` 热烈欢迎。

> `[00:04:35]` I think the camera guys are not having. Has he. Yeah I think they see much more explicitly said don\'t move the chairs and the first thing I do is move the chair. Sorry.

`[00:04:35]` 我认为摄像机里的人没有。他有没有。是的，我想他们看到更明确地说不要移动椅子，我做的第一件事就是移动椅子。对不起。

> `[00:04:46]` So tell us your names and tell us about what traveling spume does.

`[00:04:46]` 那么，告诉我们你们的名字，告诉我们旅行的水雾能起什么作用。

> `[00:04:50]` I\'m Steph Lawrence. I\'m Ashley Vale. We\'re the founders of traveling spoon traveling souvenirs food and travel market place. So we connect travelers with local authentic food experiences from meals to cooking classes to market tours all with local people in their homes around the world.

`[00:04:50]` 我是斯蒂芬·劳伦斯。我是阿什利·维尔。我们是旅游汤匙、旅游纪念品、食品和旅游市场的创始人。因此，我们把旅行者与当地的正宗食品体验联系起来，从餐食到烹饪课程，再到市场旅游，所有这些都是来自世界各地的当地人。

> `[00:05:06]` So I\'m going to let\'s say Thailand and then I would how would I find about your jobs. How to find that you exist. It\'s just me going to Thailand.

`[00:05:06]` 所以我要让我们说泰国，然后我将如何找到你的工作。如何找到你的存在。只有我要去泰国。

> `[00:05:16]` Welcome to our first challenge question. So a lot of our travelers hear about it through word of mouth right now and finding the right channels is one of our our challenges that we\'re excited to talk to you about. But right now most of our travelers find out about us either through word of mouth through press or also through some of our partners. So we work with partners who are distributing supply like our. So travel experiences.  欢迎来到我们的第一个挑战问题。因此，我们的很多旅行者现在都是通过口耳相传的方式听到这个消息的，而找到合适的渠道是我们面临的挑战之一，我们很高兴能与你们交谈。但现在，我们的大多数旅行者都是通过媒体或我们的一些合作伙伴了解到我们的情况的。所以我们和像我们这样分发供应品的合作伙伴一起工作。所以，旅行经历就是这样的。

`[00:05:42]` So the first question I usually ask about the marketplace I\'m asking about sort of like what is the conditions of the two sides that you\'re trying to grow. And then how well are they being connected. So like what do you guys consider supply. What do you guys sort of conspiracy demand. My instinct is the supply is the people who are offering meals inside of their homes and then the demand is all the travelers that happens on there. What\'s the rate of growth for each one of those.

> `[00:05:42]` 所以我通常问的关于市场的第一个问题，我想问的是，你想要发展的双方的条件是什么。然后他们之间有多好的联系。就像你们认为供应。你们有什么阴谋要求。我的直觉是，供给是那些在家里提供食物的人，而需求则是发生在那里的所有旅行者。每个人的增长率是多少？

`[00:06:07]` So you\'re absolutely right. Our supply side consists of amazing hosts who give to us cooking classes and meals. We have over 225 hosts now in 40 destinations in 20 countries 50 percent of that growth has happened through host referrals and we\'ve been growing the supply side of the marketplace 50 percent in the last six months.

> `[00:06:07]` 所以你说的完全正确。我们的供应方由出色的主人组成，他们为我们提供烹饪课程和膳食。我们现在 20 个国家的 40 个目的地拥有 225 多个主机，其中 50%的增长是通过主机推荐实现的，在过去的 6 个月里，我们已经将市场的供应面增长了 50%。

`[00:06:28]` Undersupply is a reason you\'re in so many countries and so distributed because I mean if you look I guess why would you have chosen a country like Cambodia and just say we\'re gonna get a bunch of hosts there so if we\'re going to Cambodia we\'re definitely gonna get a match.

> `[00:06:28]` 供应不足是你在这么多国家这么分散的原因之一，因为如果你看的话，我猜你为什么会选择一个像柬埔寨这样的国家，只说我们会在那里有一群东道主，所以如果我们去柬埔寨，我们肯定会得到一个匹配的。

`[00:06:42]` Yeah it\'s a great question and one of the first questions we got from every single investor we talked with beginning was this question of a breadth first depth for us where it came down to that in the travel marketplace specifically. You really need to have some breadth to show relevance. So it is really hard for us to be how so.

> `[00:06:42]` 是的，这是一个很好的问题，我们从每一个投资者那里得到的第一个问题是，对于我们来说，一个广度第一深度的问题，对于我们来说，尤其是在旅游市场。你真的需要有一定的广度才能表现出相关性。所以，我们很难做到这样。

`[00:06:59]` How did you came to that conclusion. Budget traveler said like I won\'t use this Web site because you don\'t have 200 countries covered yet.

> `[00:06:59]` 你是怎么得出这个结论的？预算旅行者说我不会使用这个网站，因为你还没有覆盖 200 个国家。

`[00:07:05]` No not that. So a lot of it came from our suppliers who would say you know we\'re sending travelers to Cambodia Vietnam Thailand. We want experiences in all of those destiny. So sometimes suppliers like some of our clients and partners that we\'re working with so we have channel partners we sell directly through our Web site driving\'s Green Dot Com and then we sell through some channel partners as well. So some of that was coming through our partners. Some of it was coming from directly from our travelers who said I traveled here and who are the partner places tour operators people who will plan two week trips from start to finish the NoW\'s demand growing. What\'s that rate. Yeah. So demand. So we as a two sided marketplace. One of the challenges is you have to kind of pick the crawling 30 percent month over month is sort of our traveler side that\'s been going through.

> `[00:07:05]` 不，不。所以很多都来自我们的供应商，他们会说你知道我们要把游客送到柬埔寨、越南、泰国。我们希望在所有这些命运中都有经验。因此，有时供应商，如我们的客户和合作伙伴，我们与之合作，因此我们有渠道合作伙伴，我们直接通过我们的网站销售的绿点 Com，然后我们销售通过一些渠道合作伙伴。所以其中的一些是通过我们的合作伙伴。其中一些直接来自我们的旅行者，他们说我到过这里，他们是合作伙伴、地方旅游运营商，他们将计划从现在开始到现在的需求增长，每两周旅行一次。这个比率是多少？嗯所以需求。所以我们作为一个双边市场。其中的一个挑战是，你必须选择一个月爬行 30%的爬行，这是我们旅行者一直在经历的。

`[00:07:48]` So that\'s healthy. To just like ideally first start up you guys have been operating for how long. We launched our site a little less than a year ago lessening a year ago. OK. So like at least 20 percent but 30 percent that\'s sort of growing but then that\'s just people signing up are people actually like.

> `[00:07:48]` 所以那是健康的。就像理想的第一次创业一样，你们已经运营了多久了。我们在一年前推出了我们的网站，一年前就减少了。好吧。至少有 20%，但是 30%是增长的，但那只是注册的人实际上喜欢的人。

`[00:08:04]` Well that\'s that\'s revenue and traveler service so travelers who have booked and then gone on and complete those disappear as a pie chart of you know where they\'re hearing about the product. How much is it these channels and how much is it word of mouth.

> `[00:08:04]` 好吧，这是收入和旅行服务，所以那些订了票，然后再去做的旅客，就像饼图一样消失了，你知道他们在哪里听说了这个产品。这些渠道多少钱，口碑多少。

`[00:08:18]` So word of mouth is certainly a big part of direct growth to working on advertising right now.

> `[00:08:18]` 因此，口碑无疑是目前从事广告工作的直接增长的重要部分。

`[00:08:23]` Joe just like percentage like what. What percentage is 60 percent is direct and 40 percent is to our partners right. So what he gets most worried about.

> `[00:08:23]` 乔就像什么百分比一样。60%是直接的，40%是给我们的合作伙伴的。所以他最担心的是。

`[00:08:31]` Finding the point at which travelers are making those experiences and planning their trips and booking with that. So how do we get in front of travelers at the point of their decision making process.

> `[00:08:31]` 找出旅行者正在进行这些体验的地点，并计划他们的旅行和预订。那么，我们如何在旅行者的决策过程中站在他们的面前呢？

`[00:08:42]` How

> `[00:08:42]` 如何

`[00:08:42]` do you get to travelers at the point of the decision making process. So are the partners not good. I mean yeah.

> `[00:08:42]` 在决策过程中，你能接触到旅行者吗？合伙人也不太好。我是说是的。

`[00:08:48]` So we want to find more of the right partner. So we\'ve started working with one partner who\'s serving almost 25 percent of our of our travelers right now and we\'re trying to find more of them so who are the right travel distribution partners that are that are supplying travelers are we talking about hundreds thousands thousands maybe.

> `[00:08:48]` 所以我们想找更多合适的搭档。因此，我们已经开始与一个合作伙伴合作，他目前为我们的 25%的旅行者提供服务，我们正在努力寻找更多这样的合作伙伴，因此谁是为旅行者提供服务的合适的旅行分销伙伴-我们谈论的也许是几十万人。

`[00:09:06]` I guess to me like the direct model doesn\'t correct me if I\'m wrong. Druck well doesn\'t make sense because no one. Like if I\'m traveling to Cambodia this year and maybe next year I traveled to India like I have to remember your company and the chance of that actually happening is really slim. One way to think about this I think about applications is they fall into two categories apps that you wake up or more products you wake up everyday news you open up gmail you open up you know snapchat without thinking about opening those up. And then there\'s a second group of apps which fulfills some mental query that you have. So I\'m going to need a restaurant they look up Yelp and he does need to address navigation. So I use Google Maps like so your product falls into the second category. But the problem is you so infrequently have that mental query you\'re no one\'s going to remember it.

> `[00:09:06]` 我想，如果我错了，直接模特就不会纠正我。德鲁克井没有意义，因为没有人。比如，如果我今年去柬埔寨旅行，也许明年我去印度旅行，就像我必须记住你的公司一样，这种情况发生的可能性很小。思考这个问题的方法之一，我认为应用程序分为两类，应用程序，你醒来的应用程序，或者更多的产品，你每天醒来的新闻，你打开的 Gmail，你知道 Snapchat 的，而不是打开的。然后是第二组应用程序，它们满足了您的一些心理问题。所以我需要一家餐馆，他们查 Yelp，他确实需要导航地址。所以我使用谷歌地图，所以你的产品属于第二类。但问题是，你很少会有这种心理问题，你没有人会记得它。

`[00:09:51]` That\'s the thing that makes me really nervous just like this is not an activity that I\'m doing many many times like Uber has advantage.

> `[00:09:51]` 这是让我非常紧张的事情，就像这不是我多次做的事情，就像 Uber 有优势一样。

`[00:09:58]` It\'s like you might have people with you multiple times even within a day not brushing your teeth it\'s not writing in October and that\'s definitely something that we struggle with in terms of finding finding the right customers.

> `[00:09:58]` 就像你可能有好几次人在你身边，即使在一天之内，不刷牙，这不是十月份写的，这肯定是我们在寻找合适的顾客方面遇到的问题。

`[00:10:07]` I mean our vision of a company with that context. Yeah why not focus on channel partners because that\'s all they\'re doing.

> `[00:10:07]` 我指的是我们对这样一家公司的愿景。是啊，为什么不把注意力集中在频道合作伙伴身上呢？因为这就是他们所做的一切。

`[00:10:14]` Yeah. So we\'ve drawn a lot of inspiration from urban bee as an example of our vision for the company is to be a brand and to be a brand for authentic meaning your vision for the company is grow and make tons of money.

> `[00:10:14]` 是的。所以我们从城市蜜蜂那里得到了很多灵感作为我们公司愿景的一个例子就是成为一个品牌和一个真正的品牌-这意味着你对公司的愿景正在成长并赚了很多钱。

`[00:10:25]` Yeah.

> `[00:10:25]` 是的。

`[00:10:26]` Yeah was like created a really great brand pushed back a little bit. The mission is really important to us. We want to make a ton of money.

> `[00:10:26]` 是的，就像创造了一个非常伟大的品牌，被推了一点点。任务对我们来说真的很重要。我们想赚一大笔钱。

`[00:10:33]` But the mission is why we started the company and we want to just just interject there. Kevin isn\'t saying is like you just shouldn\'t be like many Middle East.

> `[00:10:33]` 但是我们的任务是为什么我们成立了公司，我们只想插进去。凯文不是说你不应该像很多中东人那样。

`[00:10:43]` That\'s not the takeaway that these people keep saying yeah it\'s not it\'s just a proxy for making sure that you\'re working on something that people actually want. So it\'s important that you know I think you can do both. Yeah. Just don\'t fool yourself and don\'t use that as a rationalization for maybe an ineffective strategy. Yeah fair enough. But I guess we should go back.

> `[00:10:43]` 这不是这些人一直说的‘

`[00:11:04]` One thing that\'s missing is there\'s this makes you have all these partners. The thing is like you have all this word of mouth growth what\'s the percentage is like 60 percent coming from word of mouth and then what\'s the percentage that have really done a second booking. We have 10 percent Reby travel in the last nine months 10 percent repeat travel in the last nine months going higher and higher than expected.

> `[00:11:04]` 缺少的一件事是，这让你拥有了所有的搭档。事情是这样的：口碑增长-这个百分比是 60%-来自口碑，然后是第二次预订的百分比是多少。在过去的九个月里，我们有百分之十的 Reby 旅行，百分之十的重复旅行，在过去的九个月里，比预期的更高。

`[00:11:27]` So if you take that context of people are not going to remember your product for a while for many years. I think to me that just is like you have to work with channel partners because that\'s that\'s going to be the way that you that\'s what I would do. I don\'t know what you would choose you should do. But for me I\'m thinking I got to get that consistent growth. Word of mouth and having a brand that people recall is very it takes a long long long time. I mean the kind of benchmark in which that people automat remember you even Urbina even today has that problem. And Airbnb is like a lot bigger than your brand.

> `[00:11:27]` 所以，如果你考虑到这样的背景，人们在很长一段时间内都不会记得你的产品。对我来说，这就像你必须和频道合作伙伴一起工作，因为那将是你的方式，那就是我要做的。我不知道你会选择做什么。但对我来说，我认为我必须得到持续的增长。口碑和拥有一个人们回忆起的品牌是非常需要很长时间的。我指的是人们自动记住的那种基准，即使是在今天，Urbina 也有这个问题。Airbnb 比你的品牌要大得多。

`[00:12:00]` We have one minute left. Here\'s the thing. I feel like they just started one of the big things that you need to think about is like where there\'s like the most power hungry like users on the system the people like one you\'re like channel partners who does like active salesman on your behalf because you can\'t afford that for the price acquisition that the other one is like. Where do you find people that are addicted to the service right people who can use it over and over and over again. Because like those little people that we both talk about like are there like power travelers. People go back and forth the same countries over an area where it\'s like every single time this is going to be part of my experience that happens on there and then like like does that sort of exist. Because otherwise it\'s just going to be slow and steady. And so there\'s two types of companies that I get excited about because there\'s two parts to like getting very very huge. There\'s one that you have like everyone glorifies is the startup that grows very very quickly. Like shoots up and they become like the sort of great success overnight. There\'s another kind where it\'s just like you do this solid sort of growth but you figure out like how do I make a company that\'s going to last for 20 years. Right. And so the fact that you\'re focused on is like we care a lot about the mission that set up on there. But the thing is like what is the mission like it\'s the mission is like I\'m passionate about feeding other people\'s food like I\'m passionate about like helping these other people have income. I\'m passionate about like having people having interesting travel experience. Like three different things that happens on there. And the real thing is like I think your core idea is just like when you travel and you do it through us you could have something spectacular something very different and the same thing would have been be like yeah it\'s a lot cheaper but it\'s far more interesting as a result. And I think that\'s like a similar idea that you need to have on here also going back earlier in the conversation about breath versus that.

> `[00:12:00]` 我们还有一分钟。事情是这样的。我觉得他们刚刚开始了一件你需要考虑的大事-就像系统中最缺电的人，像你这样的人，像渠道合作伙伴，代表你的积极推销员，因为你买不起另一个人的价格。你在哪里发现那些对服务上瘾的人-正确的人-他们可以一遍又一遍地使用它。因为就像我们谈论的那些小人物一样，就像有权力的旅行者一样。人们往返于同一个国家的某个地区，就像每一次，这将是我的经验的一部分，发生在那里，然后类似于这种情况是否存在。否则它就会变得缓慢而稳定。因此，有两种类型的公司让我感到兴奋，因为有两种类型的公司喜欢变得非常庞大。你所拥有的，就像每个人都赞美的那样，是一家发展很快的初创公司。就像雨后春笋一样，它们在一夜之间就变成了那种巨大的成功。在另一种情况下，它就像你所做的那样稳步增长，但你会发现，我该如何打造一家能持续 20 年的公司。右（边），正确的所以你所关注的事实是，我们非常关心在那里设立的任务。但问题是，任务是什么，任务就像我热衷于喂养别人的食物，就像我热衷于帮助其他人获得收入一样。我对拥有有趣的旅行经历的人充满了热情。就像发生在那里的三种不同的事情。而真正的问题是，我认为你的核心想法是，当你旅行时，你通过我们，你可以有一些壮观的东西，非常不同的东西，同样的东西会是，是的，它是便宜得多，但结果是更有趣。我认为，这类似于一个类似的想法，你需要在这里有一个类似的想法，也可以追溯到关于呼吸和呼吸的对话的早期。

`[00:13:36]` I\'m still not convinced of breath strategy. Here is the prudent one only because you can\'t find channel partners you can find local agencies that work just in Thailand who can be booking hundreds if not thousands of meals a week. That\'s where business becomes powerful and the reason I think that approach that constituted approaches better is once you find those power users the Kemalist argument you can figure out how this will work in Thailand. Let\'s figure out what\'s going to work in Myanmar\'s career.

> `[00:13:36]` 我仍然不相信呼吸策略。这里有一个谨慎的做法，因为你找不到渠道合作伙伴，你可以找到在泰国工作的当地机构，他们每周可以预订数百份甚至数千份餐食。这就是商业变得强大的地方，我认为这种方法更好的方式是，一旦你找到那些强大的用户-凯末主义的观点-你就能弄清楚这在泰国会是如何运作的。让我们想一想缅甸的职业生涯将如何发展。

`[00:14:04]` We\'re going to Indiaetc. And that\'s actually exactly what we\'re doing now is focusing on Thailand specific.

> `[00:14:04]` 我们要去印度等地，这正是我们现在要做的，重点是泰国。

`[00:14:10]` So my wife\'s Thai empire buys. That\'s right. Just like that time is up.

> `[00:14:10]` 所以我妻子的泰国帝国买了。没错。就像时间到了一样。

`[00:14:16]` So with all companies what we\'re gonna talk afterwards because this is just like such a weird thing to do.

> `[00:14:16]` 对所有公司来说，我们以后要谈的是什么，因为这是一件很奇怪的事情。

`[00:14:22]` Yeah. So talk to all of them afterwards and just dive in more so. Well thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

> `[00:14:22]` 是的。所以事后和他们所有人谈谈，然后再深入到更多的地方去。非常感谢。谢谢。谢谢。谢谢

`[00:14:27]` Applause.

> `[00:14:27]` 掌声。

`[00:14:34]` Next company a human surge would a name like a soft drink.

> `[00:14:34]` 下一家公司，人潮会有一个名字，就像一杯软饮料。

`[00:14:44]` My first question is how did you come up with that name. So delicious. Me on that. OK.

> `[00:14:44]` 我的第一个问题是你是怎么想到这个名字的。太好吃了。我在这上面。好的

`[00:14:51]` Do you want to do a quick introduction of who you are and what the company does.

> `[00:14:51]` 你想快速介绍一下你是谁，公司做些什么吗？

`[00:14:54]` Absolutely. My name is Luke SEO co-founder of human search. It\'s a global emergency roster for humanitarian responders and we are marketplaces bringing together aid workers around the globe and connect them with organizations responding to disasters or emergencies in real time on demand and will enable them to scale when needed.

> `[00:14:54]` 绝对。我的名字是卢克，SEO，人类搜索的联合创始人。这是一个人道主义应急人员的全球应急名册，我们是一个市场，把全球各地的援助人员聚集在一起，并将他们与实时应对灾害或紧急情况的组织联系起来，并将使他们能够在需要时扩大规模。

`[00:15:15]` So that sounds really lovely Debbie. Are you nonprofit.

> `[00:15:15]` 那听起来真的很可爱，黛比。你是非营利组织吗。

`[00:15:19]` No I\'m for profit. We\'re like a social enterprise seeking social impact but yeah we founded the company as a as a for profit. We actually thought first to launch a foundation or link up with the nongovernmental organization but actually the sector needs this kind of development of a platform it needs a read through process to go through mortars like Kickstarter just to make sure I understand because being machine gunned a little bit of the description is so a disaster happens like a tsunami.

> `[00:15:19]` 不是为了盈利。我们就像一家寻求社会影响的社会企业，但是的，我们创建这家公司是为了盈利。我们最初想要成立一个基金会或者与非政府组织建立联系，但实际上这个行业需要这样一个平台的开发，它需要一个通读的过程来通过像 Kickstarter 这样的迫击炮，只是为了确保我理解，因为被机器枪杀一点点描述就像海啸一样发生了灾难。

`[00:15:51]` I mean nonprofit I google. I need volunteers helpers and I land on your Web site. And I basically order help. And then you send volunteers based on the criteria put in.

> `[00:15:51]` 我指的是非营利的 I Google。我需要志愿者助手，我登陆你的网站。我基本上是叫人帮忙的。然后你根据标准派出志愿者。

`[00:16:04]` Is that right. Partially. And what happens indeed when there\'s a major emergency aid organizations respond and they scale to the operation. But we\'re talking not volunteers we\'re talking renumerated professionals that work around the globe in crisis situations. OK.

> `[00:16:04]` 是这样吗？部分。当有一个主要的紧急救援组织做出反应，他们扩大到行动范围时，会发生什么？但我们说的不是志愿者，而是在危机情况下在全球范围内工作的专业人士。好的。

`[00:16:19]` Something to stop you there.

> `[00:16:19]` 有东西阻止你。

`[00:16:21]` So can I ask one question why a marketplace place why isn\'t this just like why don\'t you have if you already have these people what why was this concept of a marketplace there.

> `[00:16:21]` 那么我可以问一个问题，为什么一个集市为什么不像为什么你已经有了这些人-为什么市场的概念在那里呢？

`[00:16:32]` They\'re struggling actually to scale operation and therefore they are a non-profit organizations and other organization responding to these kind of emergencies occurred over a decade in the sector and I\'ve experienced it firsthand. Either with the incomplete team or people missing on the team or you go for two three months and they\'re asking you kindly if you want to stay because he didn\'t find a replacement for you. Right.

> `[00:16:32]` 他们实际上在努力扩大运营规模，因此他们是一个非营利组织和其他组织，对这一部门发生的这种紧急情况作出反应，我亲身经历过。要么是团队中不完整的团队或失踪人员，要么你去了两个月，他们会友好地问你是否愿意留下来，因为他找不到代替你的人。

`[00:16:54]` So how does the business model work. So you have all these people signing up to volunteer and I take it you charge the nonprofits for accessing that list.

> `[00:16:54]` 那么商业模式是如何运作的呢？所以你让所有的人都报名做志愿者，我想你会因为访问那个名单而向非营利组织收取费用。

`[00:17:03]` That\'s correct. Were the business model now is to get an annual fee annual subscription to access database search and you can search the platform is very much like you would search for a hotel or flight nowadays you just say OK I need a logistician more five years of experience has been in Africa before speak French. What whatever is the criteria that you\'re looking for and you\'ll see the top candidates that indeed recently confirm that they\'re available.

> `[00:17:03]` 那是正确的。如果现在的商业模式是收取年费，每年订阅 Access 数据库，你可以搜索这个平台，就像你现在会搜索酒店或航班一样，你只需说：好吧，我需要一名后勤人员，在非洲有五年以上的经验，然后才会说法语。无论你在寻找什么标准，你都会看到那些最优秀的候选人最近确实证实了他们是可用的。

`[00:17:28]` I

> `[00:17:28]` i

`[00:17:28]` think we should take a look at that. Now though we\'ve asked the questions we\'re going to do aU.S. review. OK. I know you\'re like I\'m going sicut I\'m safe.

> `[00:17:28]` 我们应该看看这个。现在，尽管我们已经问了一些问题，我们还是要做一次美国的复习。好的。我知道你就像我要离开美国一样，我是安全的。

`[00:17:40]` Now you\'re not safe. We switched it up. OK.

> `[00:17:40]` 现在你不安全了，我们换了。好的。

`[00:17:42]` So we took a look at your Web site and what we decided to do was just basically we don\'t go through what is the thing you most want to optimize. What\'s the thing that drives the core of your business your kind of Web site. It\'s very typical for lots of marketplace websites that I look at. It makes the same kinds of mistakes that a lot of them sort of make. So the first thing is like always interested in sort of like how do I quickly understand sort of like what this company sort of does and so like couldn\'t find the simple copy paste sentence that was like on the regular website. Went to your about page. You have this thing on here. I noticed as I talk to you you\'d like to use lots of extra words clean things on there. And to me I\'m just like yeah you know human searches are like mechanical turk orA.W. asks for like volunteers for nonprofits and you know volunteers are renumerated professionals who have set up on a can\'t remember that you\'re ruining my word of mouth. It\'s important that there\'s an important point there.

> `[00:17:42]` 所以我们看了一下你们的网站，我们决定做的就是，我们根本不去经历你们最想要优化的东西。什么东西驱动着你的核心业务-你的网站。这对于我看过的很多市场网站来说都是非常典型的。它犯的错误和很多人犯的错误是一样的。所以第一件事是，总是对某种东西感兴趣，比如，我如何快速理解，就像这家公司所做的那样，但却找不到普通网站上那种简单的复制粘贴语句。去了你的关于你的页面。你这上面有东西。我注意到，当我和你说话的时候，你会想用更多的词-干净的东西-在那里。对我来说，我就像是的，你知道，人的搜索就像机械的土耳其人或者 A.W.要求像非营利组织的志愿者一样，你知道志愿者是那些建立在罐头上的专业人士，他们不记得你破坏了我的口碑。重要的是有一个要点。

`[00:18:38]` It is hilarious but it\'s also an important point which is you don\'t want to use words like that are that are we\'re putting up on the overhead right now because they\'re loaded. They mean a lot of different things to different people so and use a word like a single platform platform can be like something that\'s like the water or it can be like infrastructure a platform can be many many different things. So you might think as a founder who is trying to describe a company I\'m using clear words you\'re not because those words you interpreted many different ways.

> `[00:18:38]` 这很好笑，但也是一个重要的问题，那就是你不想用这样的词-我们现在就把它放在头顶上，因为它们已经装好了。对于不同的人来说，它们意味着很多不同的东西，所以用一个词，比如一个平台，可以是像水一样的东西，也可以是基础设施，一个平台可以是很多不同的东西。因此，你可能会认为，作为一个试图描述一家公司的创始人，我用的是清晰的词语，而不是因为你用了很多不同的方式来解读这些词。

`[00:19:09]` The next thing I noticed is up in the upper left hand corner you get this big label here that makes me not want to sign up.

> `[00:19:09]` 我注意到的下一件事是在左上角你看到这个大标签让我不想注册。

`[00:19:17]` I\'m like I have to deal with a disaster. Right. It\'s like better product. It\'s like if you just say don\'t try me. Right.

> `[00:19:17]` 我想我得面对一场灾难。是的。它就像更好的产品。就像你说不要试我一样。对。

`[00:19:30]` So this thing is like I see so many companies that do this all time they put in data. And here\'s what I thought was the best part about your Web site you\'re Ephie. Q Your very first question is like why are we in Bayda. Which is Yeah good question but basically what you said it in here is just like hey this is basically we\'re still working on it. Right. And we\'re going to be proving if something goes wrong let us know.

> `[00:19:30]` 所以这件事就像我看到这么多公司一直在做这件事-他们把数据放进去。我认为这是你网站上最好的部分，你是艾普。问：你的第一个问题是为什么我们在贝达。这是个好问题，但基本上你在这里说的是，我们基本上还在努力。对。如果出了问题，我们会证明的。让我们知道。

`[00:19:57]` So you have eight times on our show when it was only you know that. But.

> `[00:19:57]` 所以你在我们的节目上有八次，而只有你知道这一点。但

`[00:20:02]` The thing is like every company you\'re going to be consciously working on stuff and then you have issues you want them to let go. There\'s nothing about you being in bed. Like all you\'re saying is like I want insurance for like if I make a mistake.  事情就像你将要有意识地工作的每一家公司，然后你想让他们放手。你躺在床上没有什么。就像你说的一切，就像我想要的一样，如果我犯了错，我想要保险。

> `[00:20:12]` And quite frankly people are understanding of people. Right. So the more you try to make yourself look like a faceless organization the harder it\'s going to be for someone to be like whatever happens on it. All you can do is be responsive and make things work like enterprise. It\'s actually one of those things that are counterintuitive for a lot of people work working enterprise and B2B companies. They\'re just like what if I make a mistake or things that happens on there be responsive fix things really quickly.

`[00:20:12]` 坦率地说，人们对人的理解。右（边），正确的所以，你越想让自己看起来像一个没有脸的组织，对一个人来说，无论发生什么事情，就越难成为这样的人。你所能做的就是作出反应，让事情像企业一样运作。事实上，对于很多人来说，这是违反直觉的事情之一-工作企业和 B2B 公司。它们就像，如果我犯了一个错误，或者发生在那里的事情会很快地被修复。

> `[00:20:35]` You\'re smart you\'re creative you\'ll figure all that slavery was a way for us to manage expectations a little bit with the organizations and the professionals.

`[00:20:35]` 你很聪明，你很有创造力，你会发现奴隶制是我们管理对组织和专业人士的期望的一种方式。

> `[00:20:41]` The thing is like the best thing that could ever possibly happen is that you have so much demand for your stuff on there and then you figure that out. That\'s the problem that you want to have. Do not ever be afraid or right. OK so let\'s go and do justice to just a pause on this page for you.

`[00:20:41]` 这件事就像可能发生的最好的事情，就是你在那里对你的东西有如此多的需求，然后你就明白了。这就是你想要的问题。永远不要害怕或正确。好吧，让我们去公正地为你在这一页上停留一段时间。

> `[00:20:55]` Before Kevin circled that call to action it\'s not obvious what the called action is and that\'s a big deal. I think if you asked you did a quick straw poll of the audience and you said what am I supposed to click on. There were no and one way you can do it is you just kind of squint and look at the page and try to figure out where do your eyes go and they go to about four or five blue sections and logos at the bottom.

`[00:20:55]` 凯文在圈出号召行动之前，并不清楚所谓的行动是什么，这是一件大事。我想如果你问你做了一个简短的民意测验，然后你说我应该点击什么。没有一种方法，你可以做到这一点，你只是眯着眼睛，看看页面，试着找出你的眼睛去了哪里，它们在底部有大约四五个蓝色的部分和标志。

> `[00:21:16]` It\'s just not obvious what you want me to do.

`[00:21:16]` 你想让我做什么并不明显。

> `[00:21:18]` The thing is like it\'s because your market but you said I have two sides therefore I need a Web site that does both. The thing is like that\'s just never going to work really well even if you go to air BMB or Uber A lot of different places. You see they\'re always optimized for one side of their marketplace. So you need to decide like what\'s the thing I most need to happen.  事情是这样的，因为你的市场，但你说我有两个方面，所以我需要一个网站，两者兼而有之。事情是这样的，即使你去了很多不同的地方，BMB 或者优步，你也永远也不可能工作得很好。你看，他们总是对市场的一面进行优化。所以你需要决定我最需要发生的事情是什么。

`[00:21:34]` And then the question is finally there will be our target main target.

> `[00:21:34]` 然后问题是，最终我们的目标将是主要目标。

`[00:21:38]` All right. So my feeling is like a lot of the self serve is going to come for the professionals it should be optimized for signing up the professionals and the volunteers the organizations. That\'s what you\'re going to be signing up doing B2B you\'re going out there you you\'re hitting the pavement dabber that\'s going to be on a separate landing page.

> `[00:21:38]` 好的。所以我的感觉是，很多的自我服务都是为了专业人员而来的，应该对专业人员和志愿者、组织的注册进行优化。这就是你将要注册的 B2B，你要去那里，你要撞到人行道上，你会在一个单独的登陆页面上。

`[00:21:52]` Indirect him that was actually the second landing page into the feud going on here than it would allow you immediately as a professional to register your e-mails who are trying to direct people to that second page.

> `[00:21:52]` 间接的，他，实际上是第二个登陆页，在这里进行的不和，这将使你可以立即作为一个专业人士注册你的电子邮件，谁试图引导人们进入第二页。

`[00:22:01]` So one thing that is good about the land on this landing page I think folks can take away from that last page is that the imagery is very clearly you don\'t actually need to read any of the text to understand generally what this what the product is about.

> `[00:22:01]` 我认为人们可以从最后一页中拿出一件关于登陆土地的好东西，那就是图像非常清楚，你不需要阅读任何一篇文章就能大致理解这个产品是什么样子的。

`[00:22:14]` So you do that well.

> `[00:22:14]` 所以你做得很好。

`[00:22:16]` All right. I\'m just gonna go to this real quick because let\'s see what we\'re going to do is go through the process of signing up as an organization doing the one thing that helps you make money. So I clicked on that button and I get to this page and this page. This is the top half of the page. It\'s a big map. Don\'t know what it to do on here. You scroll down you see like how many who will join bunch of drop downs and then I see the pricing plans a big gap scroll down. All right. Are called actions are down so these are the things that you want me to click to make it hard to get to. Yes.

> `[00:22:16]` 好的。我很快就会去参加，因为让我们看看我们要做的是完成注册成为一个组织的过程，做一件能帮你赚钱的事情。所以我点击了那个按钮，我找到了这个页面和这个页面。这是页面的上半部分。这是一张大地图。我不知道在这里该怎么办。你向下滚动，你会看到有多少人会加入一系列下跌，然后我看到定价计划，一个巨大的差距向下滚动。好的被称为行动是向下的，所以这些是你想让我点击的东西，使它很难到达。是

`[00:22:49]` If you\'re if you\'re talking to somebody who\'s never used a product before you\'re just asking a lot. They have to find that called action the first page and to scroll down at the bottom and then read which most people don\'t and then recognize select is the call to action.

> `[00:22:49]` 如果你和一个在你之前从未使用过产品的人交谈过，他们必须发现第一页叫做“行动”，然后向下滚动，然后阅读大多数人不喜欢的内容，然后认识到“选择”就是“行动的呼唤”。

`[00:23:04]` So let\'s go here. Now one thing I noticed is like obviously like before I\'m going to pay for a service like this I want to see how does the directory sort of work. I actually feel like you\'re treacheries basically going to be a search.

> `[00:23:04]` 让我们走吧。现在，我注意到一件事，很明显，就像我要为这样的服务付费之前，我想看看目录是如何工作的。我觉得你基本上是一种背叛，基本上是一种搜索。

`[00:23:14]` This is not a typical like search interface with all these sort of drop offs. I can eventually figure it out happen on there but it\'s one of those things like it doesn\'t use a afford Insys and it\'s one of those things where I like to talk to people all the time with the people like I\'m going to build an interface then no one has ever seen before because I want to make my mark on the world and users usually go like I have no idea how the fuck to use this.

> `[00:23:14]` 这不是一个典型的类似搜索界面，所有这些都有下降。我最终可以想出它发生在那里，但它是这样的事情之一，就像它不使用一个负担得起的因塞斯，它是一件事情，我喜欢一直与人们交谈的人，就像我\要建立一个界面，然后没有人见过，因为我想在世界上留下我的印记，用户通常会喜欢。我不知道他妈的怎么用这个。

`[00:23:37]` Because I\'ve never seen anything like it. Laughter.

> `[00:23:37]` 因为我从来没有见过这样的事。笑声。

`[00:23:41]` If you want to be an artist you should be an artist. This is a very different type of design.

> `[00:23:41]` 如果你想成为一名艺术家，你就应该成为一名艺术家。这是一种完全不同的设计。

`[00:23:46]` OK so let\'s go through here.

> `[00:23:46]` 好的，让我们从这里过去吧。

`[00:23:47]` I\'m just like I want to go through this as fast as possible and give you my first. I do my first search. I get your results is what you\'re going to get. That\'s like trying to set expectations.

> `[00:23:47]` 我就像我想尽快完成这件事，给你我的第一次机会。我做我的第一次搜索。我得到你的结果就是你将要得到的结果。这就像试图设定期望一样。

`[00:24:02]` And then scroll down and you\'ve got this button. We have a bunch of Spanish letters talking to me laughter were better and better.

> `[00:24:02]` 然后向下滚动，你就有了这个按钮。我们有一堆西班牙字母在跟我说话，笑声越来越好了。

`[00:24:11]` Right right.

> `[00:24:11]` 对。

`[00:24:12]` OK. Applause.

> `[00:24:12]` 好的。掌声。

`[00:24:21]` So I finally find something it shows me a result. I go great. I\'d go through this and I get hit this button. Problem is this button actually takes you to the sign up page for registering as a professional instead of the organization. So this will take you down a really weird rabbit hole where you want to take them to somewhere else. And I didn\'t realize I was going to go to that until I read their stuff that\'s below the call of action. All right so this is the one that you wanted to go through.

> `[00:24:21]` 所以我终于找到了一些东西，它给我展示了一个结果。我做得很好。我会经历这一切然后被按下这个按钮。问题是，这个按钮实际上带您到注册页面注册为专业人员，而不是组织。这会把你带到一个很奇怪的兔子洞里，你想把它们带到别的地方去。直到我读到他们的东西，我才意识到我要这么做。好吧，这就是你想要经历的。

`[00:24:46]` I didn\'t actually end up going through this went to the site on their watch. Now when we have dogs going to kill us. OK. Really quick on here. There\'s a lot of stuff to go through the sign up on here.

> `[00:24:46]` 我并没有真的完成这个任务，而是在他们的监视下去了现场。现在，当我们有狗要杀我们的时候。好的。在这里非常快。这里有很多东西要通过注册。

`[00:24:55]` You go through this. There\'s this action that happens. This that explains it.

> `[00:24:55]` 你经历了这一切。有一种行为发生了，这就解释了这件事。

`[00:25:01]` Go through on here. It\'s all this information asked me as a professional and quite frankly is one of those things where I\'m just like like how much money have I managed. I\'m just like I want to volunteer and help. Like why won\'t you let me help you get through here. These are like kind of the main questions that you have that you show up on the site. I see this thing on air. I don\'t see the word volunteer which is why I think I am. It\'s not for volunteers. And here\'s the thing.

> `[00:25:01]` 继续往前走。所有这些信息都是作为专业人士问我的，坦率地说，这也是我所做的事情之一，就像我管理了多少钱一样。我就像自愿帮忙一样。为什么你不让我帮你渡过难关。这些就像是你在网站上出现的主要问题。我在电视上看到这个东西。我看不出“自愿”这个词，这就是为什么我认为我是。不是给志愿者的。事情是这样的。

`[00:25:27]` Laughter bucket laughter.

> `[00:25:27]` 笑声桶笑声。

`[00:25:33]` I get to hear it as they tell me an elevator pitch. It would be great if you give me example.

> `[00:25:33]` 当他们告诉我电梯的音高时，我听到了。如果你给我举个例子，那就太好了。

`[00:25:37]` So like I\'m like I mean just get through this right. I did this. This is technically the ending of this. I\'m not sure what to do next. Vengefully figure out that this is a link. Actually have actually to go back to the stuff that I need to know.

> `[00:25:37]` 所以我就像我的意思是，把这件事做好。我做到了。从技术上讲，这就是这件事的结局。我不知道接下来该做什么。复仇地发现这是一个链接。实际上，我必须回到我需要知道的事情上。

`[00:25:52]` The only thing I care about all that information that you collect on there is actually what information to the nonprofit actually need.

> `[00:25:52]` 我唯一关心的是，你在那里收集的所有信息实际上是非营利组织真正需要的信息。

`[00:25:58]` What\'s the minimum that they need to be convinced that there\'s a professional or volunteer that\'s is who we are collected here after talking with us for ways to capture that core information that they look for when they scout for a professional indeed that\'s the information that we capture in the first Creuzot. I\'ve looked through some snapshots but I think it looks better if you look on the right.

> `[00:25:58]` 他们需要确信的最低限度是，有一名专业人士或志愿者是我们在这里收集的人，他们与我们讨论了如何捕捉他们在寻找专业人员时所寻找的核心信息-事实上，这就是我们在第一次 Creuzot 中捕捉到的信息。我看过一些快照，但我认为如果你看右边的话，效果会更好。

`[00:26:18]` I think I would disagree.

> `[00:26:18]` 我想我不同意。

`[00:26:20]` I mean I\'ll say look I think the big issue here isn\'t the point that Kevin is trying to drive home by showing all these steps is you\'re trying to tackle a lot as a very young company trying to tackle a lot in terms of functionality and features and I think that\'s maybe not the best strategy. Like you know Kevin said if I want to volunteer not as an autism professional if I just want to submit a little piece of information to get onto the site. There\'s so much I have to go over that I probably will make it to the end. And that\'s a big problem for you because that means a big party. You don\'t have a market you\'ll have actually people who are in the directory.

> `[00:26:20]` 我的意思是，听着，我认为这里的大问题不是凯文试图通过展示所有这些步骤来回家的问题，因为你作为一家非常年轻的公司，正试图解决很多功能和功能方面的问题，我认为这可能不是最好的策略。就像你知道的，凯文说，如果我想做志愿者，而不是作为自闭症专家，如果我只想提交一小部分信息进入网站。我有太多的事情要重温，所以我很可能会走到最后。这对你来说是个大问题，因为那意味着一个盛大的聚会。你没有市场，你会有真正的人在目录中。

`[00:26:56]` Twelve hundred people are 19 other people started 12 people completed the profile and confirmed their e-mail so we have over a hundred pets Gregory contacted now by over 12 0 so it\'s going to be Yeah indeed. And it\'s addressing it is actually an issue that all these organizations are struggling with. They\'re all managing this all by themselves on an Excel sheet. So we say okay we\'ll just bring it online on a platform.

> `[00:26:56]` 1200 人是 19 个人，其他 12 人开始，12 人完成了配置文件，并确认了他们的电子邮件，所以我们有超过 100 只宠物，格雷戈里现在联系了超过 12 只宠物，所以这将是真的。这个问题实际上是所有这些组织都在努力解决的问题。他们都在 Excel 表格上自己管理这一切。所以我们说，好吧，我们就把它放到一个平台上。

`[00:27:20]` I totally get it at the whole thing is I\'m out of my weekend were you in any way know. Like I actually would be like hey give me your name give me your email address. And then like tell me like a professional or you volunteer just like grab that and then you send them all for the follow up information later on. Like I just be harvesting names. The second thing is I want to make it so that like those people are super impressed by the listening that it\'s happened there.

> `[00:27:20]` 我完全明白，如果你知道的话，我的周末就要结束了。就像我会像嘿，告诉我你的名字，告诉我你的电子邮件地址。然后像专业人士一样告诉我，或者你是志愿者，就像抓取它一样，然后你把它们全部发送给后面的后续信息。好像我只是在收集名字。第二件事是，我想要这样做，这样，就像那些人一样，听到发生在那里的事情给他们留下了非常深刻的印象。

`[00:27:42]` So I wouldn\'t give take the chance that someone\'s going to search your database which isn\'t fully completed whatever and be like maybe there\'s gonna be something that could happen. Be like Look do you need people like within a month you need people in this category. We have this many in that category this morning and this this being this if you\'re interested in try to give us contact or just make it so it\'s just feel like I\'m already going to when just by looking at the information they were now in the states and trying to work with these dozen organizations to get their feedback and see how they want to use this platform.

> `[00:27:42]` 这样我就不会冒险去搜索你的数据库，你的数据库还没有完全完成，可能会有什么事情发生。就像你需要的人一样，在一个月内，你需要这个类别的人。今天早上我们有这么多这样的人，如果你对给我们联系感兴趣，或者直接联系我们，我就会觉得我已经准备好了，只要看看他们现在美国的信息，试着和这十几个组织合作，得到他们的反馈，看看他们想如何使用这个平台。

`[00:28:12]` There are more functionalities that are trying to define to go to with them to see how we can optimize it for them. I guess it\'s an ongoing process. Yeah you appreciate the feedback.

> `[00:28:12]` 还有更多的功能试图与它们一起定义，看看我们如何为它们优化它。我想这是一个持续的过程。是的，你很感激你的反馈。

`[00:28:21]` Yeah just as it were. We\'re out of time. They\'re like signaling like these and these maniacal signs and the backstage just just a couple of couple of quick points before we wrap up. You know we\'re showing you. Thank you for coming out and letting us work through your site this is actually better than a lot of sites that are that are that are a year old or six months old but it\'s used as an example. A lot of founders are folks and all these things in their companies and they don\'t recognize it so many people the first time they see your company is going to be through this. And so it\'s very important to make sure you as founders are showing your product to people who don\'t know what the company is. Make sure they understand what the landing page is. Make sure they can get through that sign up because that is you know for every time that you tell somebody by your company there\'s a thousand other people that are going to be hitting that Web site and maybe getting an incorrect.

> `[00:28:21]` 是的，就这样。我们没时间了。它们就像这样的信号，这些疯狂的信号和后台的信号，只是在我们结束之前的几个快速点。你知道我们在向你展示。谢谢你的出面，让我们通过你的网站，这实际上比很多网站有一年或六个月的历史，但它被用作一个例子。很多公司的创始人都是乡巴佬，公司里所有的事情都是这样的，他们第一次看到你的公司将要经历这一切的时候，他们就没有意识到这么多人会意识到这一点。因此，确保你作为创始人向那些不知道公司是什么的人展示你的产品是非常重要的。确保他们明白登陆页面是什么。确保他们能够通过注册，因为你知道，每次你告诉公司里的某个人，就会有上千个人访问这个网站，而且可能会得到一个不正确的结果。

`[00:29:08]` And the stuff we do is not complicated. I just walk through the site and just try to follow the path. And the thing is I try to follow the path of what\'s the fastest way that I can get to what I want or what I think you want from on there. And when you notice that like it\'s super hard to get to that point it\'s like get to touch on a when.

> `[00:29:08]` 我们所做的事情并不复杂。我只是走在网站上，试着沿着这条路走。问题是，我试着走一条通往我想要的或我认为你想要的东西的最快的道路。当你注意到你喜欢的时候，你就很难到达那个点，就像在某个时候接触到它一样。

`[00:29:23]` Well there was the lead you didn\'t show it but there\'s the lead home page where you can just leave your e-mail and say you register just e-mail or register and it totally being really obvious.

> `[00:29:23]` 这里有你没有显示的线索，但是有一个主页，你可以把你的电子邮件放在那里，说你只注册电子邮件或注册，这是非常明显的。

`[00:29:32]` But why not that be the site period. Home Page. There is like this this this. Don\'t let the big companies have all this crud that kind of builds up over time when something isn\'t working. Dump it and replace it with some. That\'s the nice thing about having a small company.

> `[00:29:32]` 但为什么不把这段时间定为场址期呢？主页。就像这样。不要让那些大公司在某件事情不起作用的情况下，随着时间的推移而产生这样的积木。扔掉它，用一些代替它。这是拥有一家小公司的好处所在。

`[00:29:48]` We\'re way over time.

> `[00:29:48]` 我们已经过了很长一段时间了。

`[00:29:49]` Thank you think.

> `[00:29:49]` 谢谢你。

`[00:29:56]` He said everyone can register. I don\'t know what happened to you.  他说每个人都可以注册。我不知道你怎么了。

> `[00:30:02]` Okay last company power of you hi. Hi.

`[00:30:02]` 好的，最后一家公司的权力。嗨

> `[00:30:14]` We\'re not we\'re not going to listen to the laughter in the comments and I was like oh God this is going to happen.

`[00:30:14]` 我们不是，我们不听评论里的笑声，我就像哦，上帝，这会发生的。

> `[00:30:23]` All right. Introduce yourself and tell us what your company does.

`[00:30:23]` 好的。自我介绍一下，告诉我们你的公司是做什么的。

> `[00:30:26]` Mine is case of money I\'m the co-founder of power of U. We help people take control of their data. I can\'t see anybody over that conversation with that. We help people take control of their data and we\'re starting by monetizing the data through market research so helping brands understand their consumers through actual behavior data rather than the clean behavior data. We can\'t let you say when you say you you mean a consumer.

`[00:30:26]` 我是 UPower 的联合创始人，我们帮助人们控制他们的数据。我看不出有谁能用这句话打断我的谈话。我们帮助人们控制他们的数据，我们首先通过市场调查将数据货币化，从而帮助品牌通过实际的行为数据而不是清洁的行为数据来了解他们的消费者。我们不能让你说你指的是消费者。

> `[00:30:47]` Correct. And then the brands are our supply side.

`[00:30:47]` 正确。那么品牌就是我们的供应方。

> `[00:30:50]` So I think one of the questions was from a demand and so actually demand becomes are brands and supply is the data from consumers.

`[00:30:50]` 所以我认为其中一个问题是来自一个需求，所以实际上需求变成了品牌，而供应是来自消费者的数据。

> `[00:30:58]` So people like you and I and everybody here is like the thing everyone\'s worried that Google is doing what they are doing it not.

`[00:30:58]` 所以像你和我这样的人，以及在座的每一个人，都像大家担心的那样，谷歌正在做他们没有做的事情。

> `[00:31:07]` But they don\'t sell like first person data or anything like that.

`[00:31:07]` 但是他们不像第一人称数据那样销售。

> `[00:31:10]` So they\'re not I guess that brings us to the first question why would I want to do this. As a consumer.

`[00:31:10]` 所以他们不是，我想这就引出了第一个问题，为什么我要这样做，作为一个消费者。

> `[00:31:15]` So it\'s already happening to your point earlier about Google so it\'s not just I mean there\'s companies out there Facebook Google and other companies actually all doing this for billions of dollars that they\'re helping us get something back. I use e-mail. I love it and we use it for free. And I want that only in here.

`[00:31:15]` 所以这件事已经发生在你早些时候关于谷歌的问题上了，所以我的意思是，不仅仅是 Facebook，谷歌和其他公司都在以数十亿美元的价格做这件事，他们帮我们找回了一些东西。我用电子邮件。我喜欢它，我们免费使用它。我只想在这里这样做。

> `[00:31:30]` I\'m just getting money.

`[00:31:30]` 我只是在拿钱。

> `[00:31:32]` I said I get what. Why would you like me in return. What do I get in return for you Monitise. So you do get paid money. How much money. How much can I make. We are we\'re monetizing at 15 dollars sixty five dollars per day to instance what if a date is then. So any time your data is used for an inside for a brand 15 to 65.

`[00:31:32]` 我说我明白什么了。你为什么要我作为回报。我能得到你什么回报莫尼提斯。所以你确实能拿到钱。多少钱。我能挣多少。我们正在以每天 15 美元的价格进行货币化，比如说，如果日期是这样的话，那么任何时候你的数据都会被用于一个品牌 15 到 65 的内部。

> `[00:31:52]` Yes. How is that about.

`[00:31:52]` 是的。那是怎么回事。

> `[00:31:56]` That\'s how much I mean we\'re doing market research. The average user that signs up for how much money they\'re making. They would. Well this is so on average because it\'s not you only get paid if your data is used Yep. So that\'s going to be about 35 dollars. If your data is you know a year a day every time. So I mean we\'re still at we just started monetizing six months ago. So it\'s early data points.

`[00:31:56]` 我的意思是我们在做市场调查。为自己赚了多少钱而注册的普通用户。他们会的。嗯，这是平均水平，因为不是只有当你的数据被使用的时候，你才能得到报酬。所以那大约是 35 美元。如果你的数据是，你知道一年一天，每次。所以我的意思是我们还在六个月前才开始赚钱。所以这是早期的数据点。

> `[00:32:20]` What percentage of total users are actually getting paid. And then how much have you paid out in the last six months.

`[00:32:20]` 实际获得报酬的用户占总用户的百分比是多少。在过去的六个月里你付了多少钱。

> `[00:32:26]` OK. So percentage wise it\'s going to be about a very small percent about 8 percent people have already gotten paid. It\'s a matter of consolidation of people of the brands and all that combination of things and the amount that we distribute back is about 3000 dollars already. So what your biggest problem right now our biggest one is actually the sales cycle to brands that\'s our biggest challenge. So what you\'re saying is it takes take anywhere from two months up to six months. And sometimes that drops out of time. Do you have enough supply to entice brands. That is something. Yes we do have enough supply in the areas that we\'re targeting heavily so specificallyU.K. andU.S.

`[00:32:26]` 好的。因此，就百分比而言，这个比例很小，大约有 8%的人已经拿到了工资。这是一个整合品牌的人的问题，所有这些东西的组合，我们已经分发了大约 3000 美元。所以，你现在最大的问题，我们最大的问题，实际上是对品牌的销售周期，这是我们最大的挑战。所以你的意思是这需要两个月到六个月的时间。有时它会从时间上消失。你们有足够的供应来吸引品牌吗？那是件事。是的，我们确实有足够的供应在我们主要瞄准的地区-英国和美国。

> `[00:33:09]` So if I\'m whatever Pepsi and I come to power you I. How much do I watch Leno pay. What\'s a normal contract look like.

`[00:33:09]` 如果我是百事可乐，我是你的掌权者，我看 Leno 的报酬是多少？正常的合同是什么样子的？

> `[00:33:18]` So it\'s normally if you come to me right. Yeah. So I would love for Pepsi to come to me. So people are starting to come which is awesome because they see the value of the data and the old laws and regulations of the amount the base that we start off with is at fifteen thousand dollars for a three week project where essentially the project is you would be bringing people onboard and we have the people that you are interested in 18 to 25 year olds in San Francisco watch. I think that how many people do I get out of my list would be anywhere from hundred to 200 people. That would be in this project. OK. So.

`[00:33:18]` 所以正常情况下，如果你来对我的话。嗯所以我很想让百事来找我。所以人们开始来了，这是很棒的，因为他们看到了数据的价值，以及旧的法律法规，我们开始的基础是一个为期三周的项目的基础是一万五千美元，这个项目实质上是你会让人们上船，我们有你对旧金山 18 到 25 岁的年轻人感兴趣的人。我想有多少人会从我的名单中出来，大概在几百到 200 人之间。在这个项目中。好的所以

> `[00:33:55]` You\'re worried about trying to build up your pipeline that happens on that. So like how often are you closing in the business.

`[00:33:55]` 你担心的是试图在这上面建立你的输油管道，就像你多久要关闭一次生意一样。

> `[00:34:02]` So it\'s for I mean we have three clients right now that we\'re working with already and we are definitely trying to bring in new business. Well it\'s it\'s an ongoing process it takes a long to do it but then we have these clients also renew on average how long does it take. It\'s going to be at least six months. Great. And then how many people do you have potentially in the pipeline that you\'re like. We have about eight people in the pipeline right now eight people how many people are emailing a day we\'re not. Probably I can tell you per week we e-mail at least three people per week.

`[00:34:02]` 所以我的意思是，我们现在有三个客户，我们已经在和他们合作了，我们肯定在尝试引入新的业务。嗯，这是一个持续的过程，需要很长时间才能完成，但是我们有这些客户，平均需要多长时间才能更新。至少要六个月。太棒了然后你有多少潜在的人在等待着你呢？我们现在有大约 8 个人，8 人，每天有多少人在发电子邮件，我们没有。也许我可以告诉你我们每周至少给三个人发电子邮件。

> `[00:34:33]` That

`[00:34:33]` 

> `[00:34:33]` is this three a whole three people because the challenge there is you want to take so you have to get to the right person and to find out whether you\'re thinking where you\'re more specifically identifying three decision makers Exactly.

`[00:34:33]` 这三个人是一个完整的三人吗？因为你想要接受的挑战，所以你必须找到正确的人，并找出你是否在思考你在哪里更具体地确定三个决策者。

> `[00:34:48]` That\'s right. So I\'m going to just say I\'m going to answer. You\'re going to blow your head like. You need to be contacting like a hundred people a day. This is like the first thing that we start telling me to be companies right away. And that is it\'s one of those things like it takes six months. Right.

`[00:34:48]` 那是对的。所以我只想说我会回答。你会像打爆你的头一样。你需要每天联系上百个人。这就像是我们第一次告诉我马上成为公司。这就是其中之一，它需要六个月的时间。

> `[00:35:04]` And let\'s say for example like you\'re working on this thing you\'re trying to hit kind of growth on there. That means like everything that you do right now to get to that point like that helps you like feed into what\'s going to happen into the future. Yes. And the thing is like a lot of people just get stuck on saying like yes I need multiple touch points but they keep overthinking what that touch point is. Right. That means so for example bottom things like the only touch points the habits like definitely a key decision maker. It has to definitely be a meeting or whatever. But really like the first touch should be like a simple email to as many people as possible. Whereas just like hi I\'m one of the founders of this we\'re doing this we\'re making this viable and what you\'re trying to find is low hanging fruit right. Those people where it\'s just like they just get it they understand it clicks and it happens on there.

`[00:35:04]` ，让我们举个例子，就像你在做这件事一样，你正试图在那里实现某种程度的增长。这意味着，就像你现在所做的一切那样，帮助你了解未来将要发生的事情。是事情是这样的，很多人只能说“是”，“我需要多个触点，但他们一直在想那个触点是什么。”右（边），正确的这意味着，例如，最底层的事情，比如唯一的触点，习惯，比如一个关键的决策者。一定要开个会什么的。但真正像第一次接触应该像一个简单的电子邮件给尽可能多的人。就像嗨，我是这个的创始人之一，我们这样做，我们使这个可行，而你想要找到的是低挂果子。那些人，就像他们得到它一样，他们明白它的咔嚓声，就发生在那里。

> `[00:35:46]` And only we\'re going to find low hanging fruit is that you\'re doing this like shock on approach in sales like the best lead Azalina hang hangs up on you because then you know you don\'t dedicating more time to it.

`[00:35:46]` 只有我们才能找到低挂的果子，那就是你在做这件事，就像对销售方式的震惊，比如最好的首席执行官 Azalina 挂断了你的电话，因为那时你知道你没有花更多的时间在这个问题上。

> `[00:35:57]` So at this phase of your company there isn\'t a lot of value in being very precise to find the specific random specific decision maker because you just want information from your customers about do they actually want this. Both brands and consumers. Right.

`[00:35:57]` 所以在你们公司的这一阶段，非常精确地找到具体的随机的决策者并没有多大的价值，因为你只是想从你的客户那里得到关于他们真的想要这个的信息。品牌和消费者都是这样。对吧。

> `[00:36:12]` You want to be promiscuous at this stage. And the thing it\'s like you don\'t it\'s like you\'re trying to predict like who I think the key decision makers are which kind of company is going like that. And it\'s really is one of the things like I see this kind of company they like us I\'m going to find a thousand other companies that Zach that I get like yeah you wait.

`[00:36:12]` 在这个阶段，你想要乱交。事情是这样的-就像你想要预测的那样-我认为关键的决策者是谁-什么样的公司会这样发展。这是我看到这样的公司的其中一件事，他们喜欢我们，我会找到其他上千家我喜欢的公司，扎克，你等着吧。

> `[00:36:26]` I mean like like we might find that like hospitals or some random group that you never even considered are actually the people who are most responsive. And before you know those could be your first you know 100 200 Tassi those are the real office hours.

`[00:36:26]` 我的意思是，就像我们可能会发现，就像医院或一些你从来没有考虑过的随机群体，实际上他们是最有反应的人。在你知道这可能是你的第一次，你知道 100，200，塔西，这是真正的办公时间。

> `[00:36:40]` I\'d be like Alright three day or three a week or whatever I think that\'s not enough. What I want to do is like basically find a list of like top Fortune 5000 companies and figure out how to e-mail like everyone that you think is in that position.

`[00:36:40]` 我会像好的，一周三天或三天，或者任何我认为还不够的。我想做的就是找到一份类似财富 5000 强公司的名单，想办法像你认为的每个人那样发电子邮件。

> `[00:36:51]` There\'s also a sub point there which Kevin is making which is the more the more companies are potential customers you e-mail the more you\'re gonna have to go outside of your preconceived assumptions of what is an ideal customer and just outside of your line of sight might actually be the truth.

`[00:36:51]` 凯文也提出了一个小点，那就是，公司越多，你通过电子邮件发送的潜在客户越多，你就越需要走出你对什么是理想客户的先入为主的假设，而仅仅在你的视线之外就可能是事实。

> `[00:37:09]` And I think that there\'s many many examples of startups which are very similar to huge companies but ultimately fail because they just didn\'t they just didn\'t get that one iteration that\'s so early on you you almost have to be very skeptical about your assumptions about what your brand what these brands and these customers want. And that\'s another reason why just doing high volume will you know we\'ll get you like learnings in a year.

`[00:37:09]` 我认为有许多初创公司的例子，它们非常类似于大公司，但最终失败了，因为它们只是没有得到如此之早的一次迭代，你几乎不得不对你对这些品牌和这些客户想要什么品牌的假设持怀疑态度。这也是为什么只做大量的事情的另一个原因，你会知道我们会在一年内让你学到很多东西。

> `[00:37:33]` And your task from there then is a lot of people said I\'m B2B enterprise. What number should I be tracking because I\'m only going to be closing maybe one or two deals over a year or whatever happens on there. And this is like all the numbers you\'re tracking is all this stuff about like how effective you\'re buying. I\'m contacting a hundred people a day. This is my response rate. This is my open right. This is my clickthrough rate. These people asked for a demo. This is how many meetings I\'ve signed up. If you\'re going to compete against someone who\'s got like a giant sales force then you don\'t compete with them by going out one at a time. You have to start thinking. And the thing is like there\'s tons of technology now available to people doing outbound sales while than ever before we fund tons of those companies now because we see that that\'s the future for how people are jumpstarting businesses. Thank you.

`[00:37:33]` 从那时起，你的任务就是很多人说我是 B2B 企业。我应该跟踪的数字是多少，因为我只会在一年内完成一两笔交易，或者发生在那里的任何事情。这就像你所追踪的所有数字都是关于你买东西有多有效。我每天联系一百个人。这是我的回应率。这是我的开场白。这是我的点击率。这些人要的是一个演示。这是我参加了多少次会议。如果你要和一个有着巨大销售力量的人竞争，那你就不会一次一个地出去和他们竞争。你得开始思考。事情是这样的，现在有大量的技术可以提供给从事对外销售的人，而现在我们比以往任何时候都要为这些公司提供资金，因为我们看到了人们开始创业的未来。谢谢。

> `[00:38:13]` So you have you\'re you\'re. That\'s one problem. OK that\'s what I was going to ask for another problem but that\'s I I a problem we\'ll do quickly one more.

`[00:38:13]` 那么你是

> `[00:38:21]` What\'s another thing that your career goes on the other side of the equation is communicating are what we\'re offering to consumers to people better so that they don\'t freak out or they understand what we\'re doing.

`[00:38:21]` 你的职业生涯的另一面是，我们向消费者提供更好的服务，这样他们才不会被吓到，或者他们明白我们在做什么。

> `[00:38:34]` It\'s think you\'re looking for people who are like I don\'t care. You\'re right. So just let me know I would do a lot of things for 65 dollars.

`[00:38:34]` 我认为你在找那些我不在乎的人。你是对的。所以让我知道我会花 65 美元做很多事情。

> `[00:38:45]` I mean if you can if you you if you can you can pay me sixty five bucks and I would just lead with that.

`[00:38:45]` 我的意思是，如果你能付我 65 块钱，我就会带头。

> `[00:38:51]` It\'s like look you give the state it you can make between this and this much money. And you don\'t think you have to do anything just connect all your stuff that happens on there and it comes passively. Exactly and that\'s the only story I need to tell is super simple. The thing is like when I go to your website you do not make that simple at all. You\'re like look at all these areas of like dimensions and graphs. They don\'t care about these graphs.

`[00:38:51]` 这就像你给了它你能在这和这么多钱之间赚到的状态。你不认为你需要做任何事情，只要把发生在那里的所有事情联系起来，它就会被动地出现。没错，这是我唯一需要讲的故事，非常简单。事情就像当我去你的网站，你根本就没有那么简单。你就像看所有这些尺寸和图形一样的区域。他们不关心这些图表。

> `[00:39:10]` Sixty five dollars laughter. Got it. Yes. OK. All right. We\'re out of time. Thank you so much.

`[00:39:10]` 65 美元的笑声。明白了。是好的好的我们没时间了非常感谢。

> `[00:39:17]` Thank you so much.

`[00:39:17]` 非常感谢。

> `[00:39:25]` OK. Real quick takeaways so marketplaces identify supply identified demand see how the rate of growth is. Try to figure out where you\'re sort of constrained if you do not need to be staff work in mass to work aggressively outside of you.

`[00:39:25]` 好的。真正快速的起飞，以便市场识别供应，确定需求，看看增长率是怎样的。如果你不需要做大量的工作来积极地在外面工作的话，试着找出你在哪里受到限制。

> `[00:39:39]` And just try not to be too Coughenour assumptions. One thing that you guys have seen these are these three very different companies similar with different companies is Kevin just focused on what are the. As we said at the beginning what are the bottlenecks to growth and really focusing on those. As a founder there\'s a limitless amount of problems that you have to deal with. You have to work on. I implore you and we implore you to think that we work on most of why seeing the programs focusing on those things which are bottlenecks to growth and because it\'s a night it\'s a nice true north. When you wake up in the morning you know what you gotta work on rather than have this company and all these different problems after you don\'t just focus on one thing. But anyways that\'s something I think you applaud.   

`[00:39:00]` 只要试着不要做太容易的假设就行了。你们看到的一件事是，这三家非常不同的公司，与不同的公司相似，凯文只是专注于什么是。正如我们在一开始所说的，增长的瓶颈是什么，并真正关注这些瓶颈。作为一名创始人，你必须面对无数的问题。你得继续努力。我恳请你们，我们恳请你们认为，我们为什么会看到节目聚焦于那些阻碍增长的事情，因为这是一个夜晚，这是一个很好的北方。当你早上醒来时，你知道你要做什么，而不是让这家公司和所有这些不同的问题在你不只是专注于一件事情之后。但不管怎样，我认为你会为之鼓掌。
